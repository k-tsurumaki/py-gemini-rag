This guide demonstrates how to automatically publish npm packages to the
GitLab package registry
by using
semantic-release
.
You can also view or fork the complete
example source
.
Initialize the module
Open a terminal and go to the project’s repository.
Run
npm init
. Name the module according to
the package registry’s naming conventions
. For example, if the project’s path is
gitlab-examples/semantic-release-npm
, name the module
@gitlab-examples/semantic-release-npm
.
Install the following npm packages:
npm install semantic-release @semantic-release/git @semantic-release/gitlab @semantic-release/npm --save-dev
Add the following properties to the module’s
package.json
:
{
"scripts"
:
{
"semantic-release"
:
"semantic-release"
},
"publishConfig"
:
{
"access"
:
"public"
},
"files"
:
[
<path(s)
to
files
here>
]
}
Update the
files
key with glob patterns that selects all files that should be included in the published module. More information about
files
can be found
in the npm documentation
.
Add a
.gitignore
file to the project to avoid committing
node_modules
:
node_modules
Configure the pipeline
Create a
.gitlab-ci.yml
with the following content:
default
:
image
:
node:latest
before_script
:
-
npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
-
|
{
echo "@${CI_PROJECT_ROOT_NAMESPACE}:registry=${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/npm/"
echo "${CI_API_V4_URL#https?}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/npm/:_authToken=\${CI_JOB_TOKEN}"
} | tee -a .npmrc
cache
:
key
:
${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
paths
:
-
.npm/
workflow
:
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH
variables
:
NPM_TOKEN
:
${CI_JOB_TOKEN}
stages
:
-
release
publish
:
stage
:
release
script
:
-
npm run semantic-release
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
This example configures the pipeline with a single job,
publish
, which runs
semantic-release
. The semantic-release library publishes new versions of the npm package and creates new GitLab releases (if necessary).
The default
before_script
generates a temporary
.npmrc
that is used to authenticate to the package registry during the
publish
job.
Set up CI/CD variables
As part of publishing a package, semantic-release increases the version number in
package.json
. For semantic-release to commit this change and push it back to GitLab, the pipeline requires a custom CI/CD variable named
GITLAB_TOKEN
. To create this variable:
Open the left sidebar.
Select
Settings
>
Access tokens
.
In your project, select
Add new token
.
In the
Token name
box, enter a token name.
Under
Select scopes
, select the
api
checkbox.
Select
Create project access token
.
Copy the token value.
On the left sidebar, select
Settings
>
CI/CD
.
Expand
Variables
.
Select
Add variable
.
Under
Visibility
, select
Masked
.
In the
Key
box, enter
GITLAB_TOKEN
.
In the
Value
box, enter the token value.
Select
Add variable
.
Configure semantic-release
semantic-release pulls its configuration information from a
.releaserc.json
file in the project. Create a
.releaserc.json
at the root of the repository:
{
"branches"
:
[
"main"
],
"plugins"
:
[
"@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
,
"@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
,
"@semantic-release/gitlab"
,
"@semantic-release/npm"
,
[
"@semantic-release/git"
,
{
"assets"
:
[
"package.json"
],
"message"
:
"chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}"
}
]
]
}
In the previous semantic-release configuration example, you can change the branch name to your project’s default branch.
Begin publishing releases
Test the pipeline by creating a commit with a message like:
fix: testing patch releases
Push the commit to the default branch. The pipeline should create a new release (
v1.0.0
) on the project’s
Releases
page and publish a new version of the package to the project’s
Package registry
page.
To create a minor release, use a commit message like:
feat: testing minor releases
Or, for a breaking change:
feat: testing major releases
BREAKING CHANGE: This is a breaking change.
More information about how commit messages are mapped to releases can be found in
semantic-releases’s documentation
.
Use the module in a project
To use the published module, add an
.npmrc
file to the project that depends on the module. For example, to use
the example project
’s module:
@gitlab-examples:registry=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/
Then, install the module:
npm install --save @gitlab-examples/semantic-release-npm
Troubleshooting
Deleted Git tags reappear
A
Git tag
deleted from the repository
can sometimes be recreated by
semantic-release
when GitLab runners use a cached
version of the repository. If the job runs on a runner with a cached repository that
still has the tag,
semantic-release
recreates the tag in the main repository.
To avoid this behavior, you can either:
Configure the runner with
GIT_STRATEGY: clone
.
Include the
git fetch --prune-tags
command
in your CI/CD script.
