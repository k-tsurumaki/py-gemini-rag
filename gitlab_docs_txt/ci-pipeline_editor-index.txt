Pipeline editor
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
The pipeline editor is the primary place to edit the GitLab CI/CD configuration in
the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file in the root of your repository. To access the editor, go to
Build
>
Pipeline editor
.
From the pipeline editor page you can:
Select the branch to work from.
Validate
your configuration syntax while editing the file.
Do a deeper
validation of your configuration
, that verifies it with any configuration
added with the
include
keyword.
View a
list of the CI/CD configuration added with the
include
keyword
.
See a
visualization
of the current configuration.
View the
full configuration
, which displays the configuration with any configuration from
include
added.
Commit
the changes to a specific branch.
Validate CI/CD syntax
As you use the pipeline editor, the pipeline configuration syntax is continually validated against
the GitLab CI/CD pipeline schema. The syntax of your CI/CD YAML and also some basic logical validations
are checked.
The result of this validation is shown at the top of the editor page. If the validation fails,
this section displays a tip to help you fix the problem.
Validate CI/CD configuration
History
Option to select different branches
introduced
in GitLab 18.4.
To test the validity of your GitLab CI/CD configuration before committing the changes,
use the pipeline editor validation tool. This tool simulates the creation of pipeline
due to a Git push event, and can help troubleshoot logic issues, including incorrect
rules
and
needs
job dependencies:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Build
>
Pipeline editor
.
Select the
Validate
tab.
Optional. Select a different branch to use for the simulated push event by using
the
Pipeline run source
dropdown list.
Select
Validate pipeline
.
The simulated pipeline uses the existing pipeline configuration from the
Edit
tab.
To validate a CI/CD YAML snippet without adding it to the
Edit
tab, use the
CI Lint tool
instead.
View included CI/CD configuration
History
Introduced
in GitLab 15.0
with a flag
named
pipeline_editor_file_tree
. Disabled by default.
Feature flag removed
in GitLab 15.1.
You can review configuration added with the
include
keyword in the pipeline editor. In the upper-right corner, select the file tree (
file-tree
)
to see a list of all included configuration files. Selected files open in a new tab
for review.
Visualize CI configuration
To view a visualization of your
.gitlab-ci.yml
configuration, in your project,
go to
Build
>
Pipeline editor
, and then select the
Visualize
tab. The
visualization shows all stages and jobs. Any
needs
relationships are displayed as lines connecting jobs together, showing the
hierarchy of execution.
Hover over a job to highlight its
needs
relationships:
If the configuration does not have any
needs
relationships, then no lines are drawn because
each job depends only on the previous stage being completed successfully.

History
View merged YAML
tab
renamed to
Full configuration
in GitLab 16.0.
To view the fully expanded CI/CD configuration as one combined file, go to the
pipeline editor’s
Full configuration
tab. This tab displays an expanded configuration
where:
Configuration imported with
include
is copied into the view.
Jobs that use
extends
display with the
extended configuration merged into the job
.
YAML anchors
are replaced with the linked configuration.
YAML
!reference
tags
are also replaced
with the linked configuration.
Conditional rules are evaluated assuming a default branch push event.
Using
!reference
tags can cause nested configuration that display with
multiple hyphens (
-
) at the start of the line in the expanded view. This behavior is expected, and the extra
hyphens do not affect the job’s execution. For example, this configuration and
fully expanded version are both valid:

Commit changes to CI configuration
The commit form appears at the bottom of each tab in the editor so you can commit
your changes at any time.
When you are satisfied with your changes, add a descriptive commit message and enter
a branch. The branch field defaults to your project’s default branch.
If you enter a new branch name, the
Start a new merge request with these changes
checkbox appears. Select it to start a new merge request after you commit the changes.
Editor accessibility options
The pipeline editor is based on the
Monaco Editor
which has several

Troubleshooting
Unable to validate CI/CD configuration.
message
This message is caused by a problem validating the syntax in the pipeline editor.
It can happen when GitLab is unable to communicate with the service that validates the syntax.
The information in these sections may not display properly:
The syntax status on the
Edit
tab (valid or invalid).
The
Visualize
tab.
The
Lint
tab.
The
Full configuration
tab.
You can still work on your CI/CD configuration and commit the changes you made without
any issues. As soon as the service becomes available again, the syntax validation
should display immediately.
