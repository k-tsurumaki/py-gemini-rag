Using PostgreSQL
Tier

As many applications depend on PostgreSQL as their database, you
have to use it to run your tests.
Use PostgreSQL with the Docker executor
To pass variables set in the GitLab UI to service containers, you must
define the variables
.
You must define your variables as either Group or Project, then call the variables in your job as shown in the following workaround.
Postgres 15.4 and later versions do not substitute schemas or owner names into extension scripts if they include quote ("), backslash (), or dollar sign ($) symbols.
If the CI variables are not configured, the value uses the environment variable name as a string instead. For example,
POSTGRES_USER: $USER
results in the
POSTGRES_USER
variable being set to ‘$USER’, which causes Postgres to show the following error:
Fatal: invalid character in extension
The workaround is to set your variables in
GitLab CI/CD variables
or set variables in string form:
Set Postgres variables in GitLab
. Variables set in the GitLab UI are not passed down to the service containers.
In the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file, specify a Postgres image:
default
:
services
:
-
postgres
In the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file, add your defined variables:
variables
:
POSTGRES_DB
:
$POSTGRES_DB
POSTGRES_USER
:
$POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
:
$POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD
:
trust
For more information about using
postgres
for the
Host
, see
How services are linked to the job
.
Configure your application to use the database, for example:
Host
:
postgres
User
:
$POSTGRES_USER
Password
:
$POSTGRES_PASSWORD
Database
:
$POSTGRES_DB
Alternatively, you can set variables as a string in the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file:
variables
:
POSTGRES_DB
:
DB_name
POSTGRES_USER
:
username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
:
password
POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD
:
trust
You can use any other Docker image available on
Docker Hub
.
For example, to use PostgreSQL 16.10, the service becomes
postgres:16.10
.
The
postgres
image can accept some environment variables. For more details,
see the documentation on
Docker Hub
.
Use PostgreSQL with the Shell executor
You can also use PostgreSQL on manually configured servers that are using
GitLab Runner with the Shell executor.
First install the PostgreSQL server:
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-client libpq-dev
The next step is to create a user, so sign in to PostgreSQL:
sudo -u postgres psql -d template1
Then create a user (in our case
runner
) which is used by your
application. Change
$password
in the following command to a strong password.
Be sure to not enter
template1=#
in the following commands, as that’s part of
the PostgreSQL prompt.
template1
=
# CREATE USER runner WITH PASSWORD '$password' CREATEDB;
The created user has the privilege to create databases (
CREATEDB
). The
following steps describe how to create a database explicitly for that user.
Privileges allow your testing framework to create and drop databases as needed.
Create the database and grant all privileges to it for the user
runner
:
template1
=
# CREATE DATABASE nice_marmot OWNER runner;
If all went well, you can now quit the database session:
template1
=
# \q
Now, try to connect to the newly created database with the user
runner
to
check that everything is in place.
psql -U runner -h localhost -d nice_marmot -W
This command explicitly directs
psql
to connect to localhost to use the md5
authentication. If you omit this step, you are denied access.
Finally, configure your application to use the database, for example:
Host
:
localhost
User
:
runner
Password
:
$password
Database
:
nice_marmot
Example project
We have set up an
Example PostgreSQL Project
for your
convenience that runs on
GitLab.com
using our publicly
available
instance runners
.
Want to hack on it? Fork it, commit, and push your changes. In a few
moments, the changes are picked by a public runner and the job begins.
