Configure CodeClimate-based Code Quality scanning (deprecated)
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
This feature was
deprecated
in GitLab 17.3 and is planned for removal in 19.0.
Integrate the results from a supported tool directly
instead. This change is a breaking change.
Code Quality includes a built-in CI/CD template,
Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yaml
.
This template runs a scan based on the open source CodeClimate scanning engine.
The CodeClimate engine runs:
Basic maintainability checks for a
set of supported languages
.
A configurable set of
plugins
, which wrap open source scanners, to analyze your source code.
Enable CodeClimate-based scanning
Prerequisites:
GitLab CI/CD configuration (
.gitlab-ci.yml
) must include the
test
stage.
If you’re using instance runners, the Code Quality job must be configured for the
Docker-in-Docker workflow
.
When using this workflow, the
/builds
volume must be mapped to allow reports to be saved.
If you’re using private runners, you should use an
alternative configuration
recommended for running Code Quality analysis more efficiently.
The runner must have enough disk space to store the generated Code Quality files. For example, on
the
GitLab project
the files are approximately 7 GB.
To enable Code Quality, either:
Enable
Auto DevOps
, which includes
Auto Code Quality
.
Include the
Code Quality template
in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file.
Example:
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
Code Quality now runs in pipelines.
On GitLab Self-Managed, if a malicious actor compromises the Code Quality job definition they
could execute privileged Docker commands on the runner host. Having proper access control policies
mitigates this attack vector by allowing access only to trusted actors.
Disable CodeClimate-based scanning
The
code_quality
job doesn’t run if the
$CODE_QUALITY_DISABLED
CI/CD variable
is present. For more information about how to define a variable, see
GitLab CI/CD variables
.
To disable Code Quality, create a custom CI/CD variable named
CODE_QUALITY_DISABLED
, for either:
The whole project
.
A single pipeline
.
Configure CodeClimate analysis plugins
By default, the
code_quality
job configures CodeClimate to:
Use
a specific set of plugins
.
Use
default configurations
for those plugins.
To scan more languages, you can enable more
plugins
.
You can also disable plugins that the
code_quality
job enables by default.
For example, to use the
SonarJava analyzer
:
Add a file named
.codeclimate.yml
to the root of your repository
Add the
enablement code
for the plugin to the root of your repository to the
.codeclimate.yml
file:
version
:
"2"
plugins
:
sonar-java
:
enabled
:
true
This adds SonarJava to the
plugins:
section of the
default
.codeclimate.yml
included in your project.
Changes to the
plugins:
section do not affect the
exclude_patterns
section of the default
.codeclimate.yml
. See the Code Climate documentation on
excluding files and folders
for more details.
Customize scan job settings
You can change the behavior of the
code_quality
scan job by setting
CI/CD variables
in your GitLab CI/CD YAML.
To configure the Code Quality job:
Declare a job with the same name as the Code Quality job, after the template’s inclusion.
Specify additional keys in the job’s stanza.
For an example, see
Download output in HTML format
.
Available CI/CD variables
Code Quality can be customized by defining available CI/CD variables:
CI/CD variable
Description
CODECLIMATE_DEBUG
Set to enable
Code Climate debug mode
.
CODECLIMATE_DEV
Set to enable
--dev
mode which lets you run engines not known to the CLI.
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
Set a prefix to use with all
docker pull
commands in CodeClimate engines. Useful for
offline scanning
. For more information, see
Use a private container registry
.
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
Set to specify the username for the registry domain parsed from
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
.
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
Set to specify the password for the registry domain parsed from
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
.
CODE_QUALITY_DISABLED
Prevents the Code Quality job from running.
CODE_QUALITY_IMAGE
Set to a fully prefixed image name. Image must be accessible from your job environment.
ENGINE_MEMORY_LIMIT_BYTES
Set the memory limit for engines. Default: 1,024,000,000 bytes.
REPORT_STDOUT
Set to print the report to
STDOUT
instead of generating the usual report file.
REPORT_FORMAT
Set to control the format of the generated report file. Either
json
or
html
.
SOURCE_CODE
Path to the source code to scan. Must be the absolute path to a directory where cloned sources are stored.
TIMEOUT_SECONDS
Custom timeout per engine container for the
codeclimate analyze
command. Default: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
Output
Code Quality outputs a report containing details of issues found. The content of this report is
processed internally and the results shown in the UI. The report is also output as a job artifact of
the
code_quality
job, named
gl-code-quality-report.json
. You can optionally output the report in
HTML format. For example, you could publish the HTML format file on GitLab Pages for even easier
reviewing.
Output in JSON and HTML format
To output the Code Quality report in JSON and HTML format, you create an additional job. This requires
Code Quality to be run twice, once each for file format.
To output the Code Quality report in HTML format, add another job to your template by using
extends: code_quality
:
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality_html
:
extends
:
code_quality
variables
:
REPORT_FORMAT
:
html
artifacts
:
paths
:
[
gl-code-quality-report.html]
Both the JSON and HTML files are output as job artifacts. The HTML file is contained in the
artifacts.zip
job artifact.
Output in only HTML format
To download the Code Quality report in only HTML format, set
REPORT_FORMAT
to
html
, overriding
the default definition of the
code_quality
job.
This does not create a JSON format file, so Code Quality results are not shown in the merge request
widget, pipeline report, or changes view.
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality
:
variables
:
REPORT_FORMAT
:
html
artifacts
:
paths
:
[
gl-code-quality-report.html]
The HTML file is output as a job artifact.
Use Code Quality with merge request pipelines
The default Code Quality configuration does not allow the
code_quality
job to run on
merge request pipelines
.
To enable Code Quality to run on merge request pipelines, overwrite the code quality
rules
,
or
workflow: rules
, so that they match your current
rules
.
For example:
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality
:
rules
:
-
if
:
$CODE_QUALITY_DISABLED
when
:
never
-
if
:
$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
# Run code quality job in merge request pipelines
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
# Run code quality job in pipelines on the default branch (but not in other branch pipelines)
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_TAG
# Run code quality job in pipelines for tags
Change how CodeClimate images are downloaded
The CodeClimate engine downloads container images to run each of its plugins.
By default, the images are downloaded from Docker Hub.
You can change the image source to improve performance, work around Docker Hub rate limits, or use a private registry.
Use the Dependency Proxy to download images
You can use a Dependency Proxy to reduce the time taken to download dependencies.
Prerequisites:
Dependency Proxy
enabled in the project’s
group.
To reference the Dependency Proxy, configure the following variables in the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file:
CODE_QUALITY_IMAGE
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
For example:
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality
:
variables
:
## You must add a trailing slash to `$CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_GROUP_IMAGE_PREFIX`.
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
:
$CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_GROUP_IMAGE_PREFIX/
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
:
$CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_USER
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
:
$CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_PASSWORD
Use Docker Hub with authentication
You can use Docker Hub as an alternate source of the Code Quality images.
Prerequisites:
Add the username and password as
protected CI/CD variables
in the project.
To use DockerHub, configure the following variables in the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file:
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
Example:
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality
:
variables
:
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
:
"registry-1.docker.io/"
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
:
$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
:
$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD
Use a private container image registry
Using a private container image registry can reduce the time taken to download images, and also
reduce external dependencies. You must configure the registry prefix to be passed down
to CodeClimate’s subsequent
docker pull
commands for individual engines, because of
the nested method of container execution.
The following variables can address all of the required image pulls:
CODE_QUALITY_IMAGE
: A fully prefixed image name that can be located anywhere
accessible from your job environment. GitLab container registry can be used here
to host your own copy.
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
: The domain of your intended container image registry. This
is a configuration option supported by
CodeClimate CLI
.
You must:
Include a trailing slash (
/
).
Not include a protocol prefix, such as
https://
.
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
: An optional variable to specify the username for the registry domain parsed from
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
.
CODECLIMATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
: An optional variable to specify the password for the registry domain parsed from
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
.
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality
:
variables
:
CODE_QUALITY_IMAGE
:
"my-private-registry.local:12345/codequality:0.85.24"
CODECLIMATE_PREFIX
:
"my-private-registry.local:12345/"
This example is specific to GitLab Code Quality. For more general instructions on how to configure
DinD with a registry mirror, see
Enable registry mirror for Docker-in-Docker service
.
Required images
The following images are required for the
default
.codeclimate.yml
:
codeclimate/codeclimate-structure:latest
codeclimate/codeclimate-csslint:latest
codeclimate/codeclimate-coffeelint:latest
codeclimate/codeclimate-duplication:latest
codeclimate/codeclimate-eslint:latest
codeclimate/codeclimate-fixme:latest
codeclimate/codeclimate-rubocop:rubocop-0-92
If you are using a custom
.codeclimate.yml
configuration file, you must add the specified plugins in your private container registry.
Change Runner configuration
CodeClimate runs separate containers for each of its analysis steps.
You may need to adjust your Runner configuration so that CodeClimate-based scans can run, or so that they run faster.
Use private runners
If you have private runners, you should use this configuration for improved performance of Code
Quality because:
Privileged mode is not used.
Docker-in-Docker is not used.
Docker images, including all CodeClimate images, are cached, and not re-fetched for subsequent jobs.
This alternative configuration uses socket binding to share the Runner’s Docker daemon
with the job environment. Before implementing this configuration, consider its
limitations
.
To use private runners:
Register a new runner:
$ gitlab-runner register --executor
"docker"
\
--docker-image
=
"docker:cli"
\
--url
"https://gitlab.com/"
\
--description
"cq-sans-dind"
\
--docker-volumes
"/cache"
\
--docker-volumes
"/builds:/builds"
\
--docker-volumes
"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
\
--registration-token
=
"<project_token>"
\
--non-interactive
Optional, but recommended
: Set the builds directory to
/tmp/builds
,
so job artifacts are periodically purged from the runner host. If you skip
this step, you must clean up the default builds directory (
/builds
) yourself.
You can do this by adding the following two flags to
gitlab-runner register
in the previous step.
--builds-dir
"/tmp/builds"
--docker-volumes
"/tmp/builds:/tmp/builds"
# Use this instead of --docker-volumes "/builds:/builds"
The resulting configuration:
[[
runners
]]
name
=
"cq-sans-dind"
url
=
"https://gitlab.com/"
token
=
"<project_token>"
executor
=

Apply two overrides to the
code_quality
job created by the template:
include

-
template
:
Jobs/Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml
code_quality
:
services
:
# Shut off Docker-in-Docker
tags
:
-
cq-sans-dind
# Set this job to only run on our new specialized runner
Code Quality now runs in standard Docker mode.
Run CodeClimate rootless with private runners
If you are using private runners and would like to run the Code Quality scans
in rootless Docker mode
code quality requires some special changes to allow it to run properly. This may require having a runner dedicated to running only code quality jobs because changes in socket binding may cause problems in other jobs.
To use a rootless private runner:
Register a new runner:
Replace
/run/user/<gitlab-runner-user>/docker.sock
with the path to the local
docker.sock
for the
gitlab-runner
user.
$ gitlab-runner register --executor
"docker"
\
--docker-image
=
"docker:cli"
\
--url
"https://gitlab.com/"
\

code_quality
:
services
:
variables
:
DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH
:
/run/user/997/docker.sock
tags
:
-
cq-rootless
Code Quality now runs in standard Docker mode and rootless.
The same configuration is required if your goal is to
use rootless Podman to run Docker
with code quality. Make sure to replace
/run/user/<gitlab-runner-user>/docker.sock
with the correct
podman.sock
path in your system, for example:
/run/user/<gitlab-runner-user>/podman/podman.sock
.
Configure Kubernetes or OpenShift runners
You must set up Docker in a Docker container (Docker-in-Docker) to use Code Quality. The Kubernetes executor
supports Docker-in-Docker
.
To ensure Code Quality jobs can run on a Kubernetes executor:
If you’re using TLS to communicate with the Docker daemon, the executor
must be running in privileged mode
. Additionally, the certificate directory must be
specified as a volume mount
.
It is possible that the DinD service doesn’t start up fully before the Code Quality job starts. This is a limitation documented in
Troubleshooting the Kubernetes executor
. To resolve the issue, use
before_script
to wait for the Docker daemon to fully boot up. For an example, see the configuration in the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file described in the following section.
Kubernetes
To run Code Quality in Kubernetes:
The Docker in Docker service must be added as a service container in the
config.toml
file.
The Docker daemon in the service container must listen on a TCP and UNIX socket, as both sockets are required by Code Quality.
The Docker socket must be shared with a volume.
Due to a
Docker requirement
, the privileged flag
must be enabled for the service container.

of the
values.yaml
file.
x
To ensure that you use the
overlay2
storage driver
, which offers the best overall performance:
Specify the
DOCKER_HOST
that the Docker CLI communicates with.
Set the
DOCKER_DRIVER
variable to empty.
Use the
before_script
section to wait for the Docker daemon to fully boot up. Since GitLab Runner v16.9, this can also be done
by just setting the
HEALTHCHECK_TCP_PORT
variable
.

OpenShift
For OpenShift, you should use the
GitLab Runner Operator
.
To give the Docker daemon in the service container permissions to initialize its storage,
you must mount the
/var/lib
directory as a volume mount.
If you cannot to mount the
/var/lib
directory as a volume mount, you can set
--storage-driver
to
vfs
instead.
If you opt for the
vfs
value, it might have a negative
impact on
performance
.
To configure permissions for the Docker daemon:
Create a
config.toml
file with this configuration template to customize the runner’s configuration:

to the build Pod. This depends on your OpenShift cluster setup:
oc create sa dind-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z dind-sa
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user -z dind-sa privileged
Set the permissions in the

Volumes and Docker storage
Docker stores all of its data in the
/var/lib
volume, which could result in a large volume. To reuse Docker-in-Docker storage across the cluster,
you can use
Persistent Volumes
as an alternative.
