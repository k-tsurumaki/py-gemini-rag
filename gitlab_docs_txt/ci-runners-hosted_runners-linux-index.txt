Hosted runners on Linux
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com
Hosted runners on Linux for GitLab.com run on Google Cloud Compute Engine. Each job gets a fully isolated, ephemeral virtual machine (VM). The default region is
us-east1
.
Each VM uses the Google Container-Optimized OS (COS) and the latest version of Docker Engine running the
docker+machine
executor
.
The machine type and underlying processor type might change. Jobs optimized for a specific processor design might behave inconsistently.
Untagged
jobs run on the
small
Linux x86-64 runner.
Machine types available for Linux - x86-64

Users can experience network connectivity issues when they use Docker-in-Docker with hosted runners on Linux
Arm. This issue occurs when the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value in Google Cloud and Docker don’t match.
To resolve this issue, set
--mtu=1400
in the client side Docker configuration.
For more details, see
issue 473739
.
Container images
As runners on Linux are using the
docker+machine
executor
,
you can choose any container image by defining the
image
in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file.
Ensure your selected Docker image is compatible with your processor architecture.
If no image is set, the default is
ruby:3.1
.
Docker-in-Docker support
Runners with any of the
saas-linux-<size>-<architecture>
tags are configured to run in
privileged
mode
to support
Docker-in-Docker
.
With these runners, you can build Docker images natively or run multiple containers in your isolated job.
Runners with the
gitlab-org
tag do not run in
privileged
mode and cannot be used for Docker-in-Docker builds.
Example
.gitlab-ci.yml
file
To use a machine type other than
small
, add a
tags:
keyword to your job.
For example:
job_small
:
script
:
-
echo "This job is untagged and runs on the default small Linux x86-64 instance"
job_medium
:
tags
:
-
saas-linux-medium-amd64
script
:
-
echo "This job runs on the medium Linux x86-64 instance"
job_large
:
tags
:
-
saas-linux-large-arm64
script
:
-
echo "This job runs on the large Linux Arm64 instance"
