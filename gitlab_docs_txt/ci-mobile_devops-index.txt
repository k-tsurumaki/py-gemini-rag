Build, sign, and release native and cross-platform mobile apps for Android and iOS by using GitLab CI/CD.
GitLab Mobile DevOps provides tools and best practices to automate your mobile app development workflow.
GitLab Mobile DevOps integrates key mobile development capabilities into the GitLab DevSecOps platform:
Build environments for iOS and Android development
Secure code signing and certificate management
App store distribution for Google Play and Apple App Store
Build environments
For complete control over the build environment, you can use
GitLab-hosted runners
,
or set up
self-managed runners
.
Code signing
All Android and iOS apps must be securely signed before being distributed through
the various app stores. Signing ensures that applications haven’t been tampered with
before reaching a user’s device.
With
project-level secure files
, you can store the following
in GitLab, so that they can be used to securely sign apps in CI/CD builds:
Keystores
Provision profiles
Signing certificates
For an overview, see
Project-level secure files demo
.
Distribution
Signed builds can be uploaded to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store by using
the Mobile DevOps Distribution integrations.
