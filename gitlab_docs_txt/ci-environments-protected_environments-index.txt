Environments
can be used for both testing and
production reasons.
Because deploy jobs can be raised by different users with different roles, it’s
important to be able to protect specific environments from the effects of
unauthorized users.
By default, a protected environment ensures that only people with the
appropriate privileges can deploy to it, keeping the environment safe.
GitLab administrators can use all environments, including protected environments.
To protect, update, or unprotect an environment, you need to have at least the
Maintainer role.
Protecting environments
Prerequisites:
When granting the
Allowed to deploy
permission to an approver group, the user configuring the protected environment must be a
direct member
of the approver group to be added. Otherwise, the group or subgroup does not show up in the dropdown list. For more information see
issue #345140
.
When granting
Approvers
permissions to an approver group or project, by default only direct members of the approver group or project receive these permissions. To also grant these permissions to inherited members of the approver group or project:
Select the
Enable group inheritance
checkbox.
Use the API
.
To protect an environment:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
CI/CD
.
Expand
Protected environments
.
Select
Protect an environment
.
From the
Environment
list, select the environment you want to protect.
In the
Allowed to deploy
list, select the role, users, or groups you
want to give deploy access to. Keep in mind that:
There are two roles to choose from:
Maintainers
: Allows access to all of the project’s users with the Maintainer role.
Developers
: Allows access to all of the project’s users with the Maintainer and Developer role.
You can also select groups that are already
invited
to the project. Invited groups added to the project with the Reporter role appear in the dropdown list for
deployment-only access
.
You can also select specific users. The users must have at least the Developer role to appear in
the
Allowed to deploy
list.
In the
Approvers
list, select the role, users, or groups you
want to give deploy access to. Keep in mind that:
There are two roles to choose from:
Maintainers
: Allows access to all of the project’s users with the Maintainer role.
Developers
: Allows access to all of the project’s users with the Maintainer and Developer role.
You can only select groups that are already
invited
to the project.
Users must have at least the Developer role to appear in
the
Approvers
list.
In the
Approval rules
section:
Ensure that this number is less than or equal to the number of members in
the rule.
See
Deployment Approvals
for more information about this feature.
Select
Protect
.
The protected environment now appears in the list of protected environments.
Use the API to protect an environment
Alternatively, you can use the API to protect an environment:
Use a project with a CI that creates an environment. For example:
stages
:
-
test
-
deploy
test
:
stage
:
test
script
:
-
'echo "Testing Application: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME}"'
production
:
stage
:
deploy
when
:
manual
script
:
-
'echo "Deploying to ${CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}"'
environment
:
name
:
${CI_JOB_NAME}
Use the UI to
create a new group
.
For example, this group is called
protected-access-group
and has the group ID
9899826
. Note
that the rest of the examples in these steps use this group.
Use the API to add a user to the group as a reporter:
$ curl --request POST --header
"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>"
\
--data
"user_id=3222377&access_level=20"
"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/9899826/members"
{
"id"
:3222377,
"name"
:
"Sean Carroll"
,
"username"
:
"sfcarroll"
,
"state"
:
"active"
,
"avatar_url"
:
"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/3222377/avatar.png"
,
"web_url"
:
"https://gitlab.com/sfcarroll"
,
"access_level"
:20,
"created_at"
:
"2020-10-26T17:37:50.309Z"
,
"expires_at"
:null
}
Use the API to add the group to the project as a reporter:
$ curl --request POST --header
"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>"
\
--request POST
"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/22034114/share?group_id=9899826&group_access=20"
{
"id"
:1233335,
"project_id"
:22034114,
"group_id"
:9899826,
"group_access"
:20,
"expires_at"
:null
}
Use the API to add the group with protected environment access:
curl --header
'Content-Type: application/json'
--request POST --data
'{"name": "production", "deploy_access_levels": [{"group_id": 9899826}]}'
\
--header
"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>"
"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/22034114/protected_environments"
The group now has access and can be seen in the UI.
Environment access by group membership
A user may be granted access to protected environments as part of
group membership
. Users
with the Reporter role can only be granted access to protected environments with this
method.
Deployment branch access
Users with the Developer role can be granted
access to a protected environment through any of these methods:
As an individual contributor, through a role.
Through a group membership.
If the user also has push or merge access to the branch deployed on production,
they have the following privileges:
Stop an environment
.
Delete an environment
.
Create an environment terminal
.
Deployment-only access to protected environments
Users granted access to a protected environment, but not push or merge access
to the branch deployed to it, are only granted access to deploy the environment.
Invited groups
added
to the project with
Reporter role
, appear in the dropdown list for deployment-only access.
To add deployment-only access:
Create a group with members who are granted to access to the protected environment, if it doesn’t exist yet.
Invite the group
to the project with the Reporter role.
Follow the steps in
Protecting Environments
.
Modifying and unprotecting environments
Maintainers can:
Update existing protected environments at any time by changing the access in the
Allowed to Deploy
dropdown list.
Unprotect a protected environment by selecting the
Unprotect
button for that environment.
After an environment is unprotected, all access entries are deleted and must
be re-entered if the environment is re-protected.
After an approval rule is deleted, previously approved deployments do not show who approved the deployment.
Information on who approved a deployment is still available in the
project audit events
.
If a new rule is added, previous deployments show the new rules without the option to approve the deployment.
Issue 506687
proposes to show the full approval history of deployments, even if an approval rule is deleted.

Deployment safety

Group-level protected environments
Typically, large enterprise organizations have an explicit permission boundary
between
developers and operators
.
Developers build and test their code, and operators deploy and monitor the
application. With group-level protected environments, operators can
restrict access to critical environments from developers. Group-level protected environments
extend the
project-level protected environments
to the group-level.
The permissions of deployments can be illustrated in the following table:
Environment
Developer
Operator
Category
Development
Allowed
Allowed
Lower environment
Testing
Allowed
Allowed
Lower environment
Staging
Disallowed
Allowed
Higher environment
Production
Disallowed

Higher environment
(Reference:
Deployment environments on Wikipedia
)
Group-level protected environments names
Contrary to project-level protected environments, group-level protected
environments use the
deployment tier
as their name.
A group may consist of many project environments that have unique names.
For example, Project-A has a
gprd
environment and Project-B has a
Production
environment, so protecting a specific environment name doesn’t scale well.
By using deployment tiers, both are recognized as
production
deployment tier
and are protected at the same time.
Configure group-level memberships
History
Operators are required to have Owner+ role from the original Maintainer+ role and this role change is introduced from GitLab 15.3
with a flag
named
group_level_protected_environment_settings_permission
. Enabled by default.
Feature flag removed
in GitLab 15.4.
To maximize the effectiveness of group-level protected environments,
group-level memberships
must be correctly
configured:
Operators should be given the Owner role
for the top-level group. They can maintain CI/CD configurations for
the higher environments (such as production) in the group-level settings page,
which includes group-level protected environments,
group-level runners
, and
group-level clusters
. Those
configurations are inherited to the child projects as read-only entries.
This ensures that only operators can configure the organization-wide
deployment ruleset.
Developers should be given no more than the Developer role
for the top-level group, or explicitly given the Owner role for a child project.
They do not have access to the CI/CD configurations in the
top-level group, so operators can ensure that the critical configuration won’t
be accidentally changed by the developers.
For subgroups and child projects:
Regarding
subgroups
, if a higher
group has configured the group-level protected environment, the lower groups
cannot override it.
Project-level protected environments
can be
combined with the group-level setting. If both group-level and project-level
environment configurations exist, to run a deployment job, the user must be allowed in
both
rulesets.
In a project or a subgroup of the top-level group, developers can be
safely assigned the Maintainer role to tune their lower environments (such
as
testing
).
Having this configuration in place:
If a user is about to run a deployment job in a project and allowed to deploy
to the environment, the deployment job proceeds.
If a user is about to run a deployment job in a project but disallowed to
deploy to the environment, the deployment job fails with an error message.
Protect critical environments under a group
To protect a group-level environment, make sure your environments have the correct
deployment_tier
defined in
.gitlab-ci.yml
.
Using the UI
History
Introduced
in GitLab 15.1.
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your group. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
CI/CD
.
Expand
Protected environments
.
From the
Environment
list, select the
deployment tier of environments
you want to protect.
In the
Allowed to deploy
list, select the
subgroups
you want to give deploy access to.
Select
Protect
.
Using the API
Configure the group-level protected environments by using the
REST API
.
Deployment approvals
Protected environments can also be used to require manual approvals before deployments. See
Deployment approvals
for more information.
Troubleshooting
Reporter can’t run a trigger job that deploys to a protected environment in downstream pipeline
A user who has
deployment-only access to protected environments
might
not
be able to run a job if it’s with a
trigger
keyword. This is because the job is missing the
environment
keyword definition to associate the job with the protected environment, therefore the job is recognized as a standard job that uses
regular CI/CD permission model
.
See
this issue
for more information about supporting
environment
keyword with
trigger
keyword.
