Use CI/CD variables in job scripts
Tier

Offering

All CI/CD variables are set as environment variables in the job’s environment.
You can use variables in job scripts with the standard formatting for each environment’s
shell.
To access environment variables, use the syntax for your
runner executor’s shell
.
With Bash,
sh
and similar
To access environment variables in Bash,
sh
, and similar shells, prefix the
CI/CD variable with (
$
):
job_name
:
script
:
-
echo "$CI_JOB_ID"
With PowerShell
To access variables in a Windows PowerShell environment, including environment
variables set by the system, prefix the variable name with
$env:
or
$
:
job_name
:
script
:
-
echo $env:CI_JOB_ID
-
echo $CI_JOB_ID
-
echo $env:PATH
In
some cases
environment variables must be surrounded by quotes to expand properly:
job_name
:
script
:
-
D:\\qislsf\\apache-ant-1.10.5\\bin\\ant.bat "-DsosposDailyUsr=$env:SOSPOS_DAILY_USR" portal_test
With Windows Batch
To access CI/CD variables in Windows Batch, surround the variable with
%
:
job_name
:
script
:
-
echo %CI_JOB_ID%
You can also surround the variable with
!
for
delayed expansion
.
Delayed expansion might be needed for variables that contain white spaces or newlines:
job_name
:
script
:
-
echo !ERROR_MESSAGE!
In service containers
Service containers
can use CI/CD variables, but
by default can only access
variables saved in the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file
.
Variables
added in the GitLab UI
are not available to
service containers, because service containers are not trusted by default.
To make a UI-defined variable available in a service container, you can re-assign
it to another variable in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
:
variables
:
SA_PASSWORD_YAML_FILE
:
$SA_PASSWORD_UI
The re-assigned variable cannot have the same name as the original variable. Otherwise it does not get expanded.
Pass an environment variable to another job
You can create a new environment variable in a job, and pass it to another job
in a later stage. These variables cannot be used as CI/CD variables to configure a pipeline
(for example with the
rules
keyword
), but they can be used in job scripts.
To pass a job-created environment variable to other jobs:
In the job script, save the variable as a
.env
file.
The format of the file must be one variable definition per line.
Each line must be formatted as:
VARIABLE_NAME=ANY VALUE HERE
.
Values can be wrapped in quotes, but cannot contain newline characters.
Save the
.env
file as an
artifacts:reports:dotenv
artifact.
Jobs in later stages can then use the variable in scripts, unless
jobs are configured to not receive
dotenv
variables
.
For example:
build-job
:
stage
:
build
script
:
-
echo "BUILD_VARIABLE=value_from_build_job" >> build.env
artifacts
:
reports
:
dotenv
:
build.env
test-job
:
stage
:
test
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VARIABLE"
# Output is: 'value_from_build_job'
Variables from
dotenv
reports
take precedence
over
certain types of new variable definitions such as job defined variables.
You can also
pass
dotenv
variables to downstream pipelines
.
Control which jobs receive
dotenv
variables
You can use the
dependencies
or
needs
keywords to control which jobs receive the
dotenv
artifacts.
To have no environment variables from a
dotenv
artifact:
Pass an empty
dependencies
or
needs
array.
Pass
needs:artifacts
as
false
.
Set
needs
to only list jobs that do not have a
dotenv
artifact.
For example:
build-job1
:
stage
:
build
script
:
-
echo "BUILD_VERSION=v1.0.0" >> build.env
artifacts
:
reports
:
dotenv
:
build.env
build-job2
:
stage
:
build
needs
:
[]
script
:
-
echo "This job has no dotenv artifacts"
test-job1
:
stage
:
test
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VERSION"
# Output is: 'v1.0.0'
dependencies
:
-
build-job1
test-job2
:
stage
:
test
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VERSION"
# Output is ''
dependencies
:
[]
test-job3
:
stage
:
test
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VERSION"
# Output is: 'v1.0.0'
needs
:
-
build-job1
test-job4
:
stage
:
test
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VERSION"
# Output is: 'v1.0.0'
needs
:
-
job
:
build-job1
artifacts
:
true
test-job5
:
stage
:
deploy
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VERSION"
# Output is ''
needs
:
-
job
:
build-job1
artifacts
:
false
test-job6
:
stage
:
deploy
script
:
-
echo "$BUILD_VERSION"
# Output is ''
needs
:
-
build-job2
Pass an environment variable from the
script
section to
artifacts
or
cache
History
Introduced
in GitLab 16.4.
Use
$GITLAB_ENV
to use environment variables defined in the
script
section in the
artifacts
or
cache
keywords. For example:
build-job
:
stage
:
build
script
:
-
echo "ARCH=$(arch)" >> $GITLAB_ENV
-
touch some-file-$(arch)
artifacts
:
paths
:
-
some-file-$ARCH
Store multiple values in one variable
You cannot create a CI/CD variable that is an array of values, but you
can use shell scripting techniques for similar behavior.
For example, you can store multiple values separated by a space in a variable,
then loop through the values with a script:
job1
:
variables
:
FOLDERS
:
src test docs
script
:
-
|
for FOLDER in $FOLDERS
do
echo "The path is root/${FOLDER}"
done
Use CI/CD variables in other variables
You can use variables inside other variables:
job
:
variables
:
FLAGS
:
'-al'
LS_CMD
:
'ls "$FLAGS"'
script
:
-
'eval "$LS_CMD"'
# Executes 'ls -al'
As part of a string
You can use variables as part of a string. You can surround the variables with curly brackets (
{}
)
to help distinguish the variable name from the surrounding text. Without curly brackets,
the adjacent text is interpreted as part of the variable name. For example:
job
:
variables
:
FLAGS
:
'-al'
DIR
:
'path/to/directory'
LS_CMD
:
'ls "$FLAGS"'
CD_CMD
:
'cd "${DIR}_files"'
script
:
-
'eval "$LS_CMD"'
# Executes 'ls -al'
-
'eval "$CD_CMD"'
# Executes 'cd path/to/directory_files'
Use the
$
character in CI/CD variables
If you do not want the
$
character interpreted as the start of another variable,
use
$$
instead:
job
:
variables
:
FLAGS
:
'-al'
LS_CMD
:
'ls "$FLAGS" $$TMP_DIR'
script
:
-
'eval "$LS_CMD"'
# Executes 'ls -al $TMP_DIR'
This does not work when
passing a CI/CD variable to a downstream pipeline
.
