Environments Dashboard
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering

The Environments Dashboard provides a cross-project
environment-based view that lets you see the big picture
of what is going on in each environment. From a single
location, you can track the progress as changes flow
from development to staging, and then to production (or
through any series of custom environment flows you can set up).
With an at-a-glance view of multiple projects, you can instantly
see which pipelines are green and which are red allowing you to
diagnose if there is a block at a particular point, or if there’s
a more systemic problem you need to investigate.

The Environments dashboard displays a paginated list of projects that includes
up to three environments per project.
Each project displays its configured environments.
Review apps and other grouped environments are not displayed.
Adding a project to the dashboard
To add a project to the dashboard:
Select
Add projects
in the home screen of the dashboard.
Search and add one or more projects using the

Once added, you can see a summary of each project’s environment operational
health, including the latest commit, pipeline status, and deployment time.
The Environments and
Operations
dashboards share the same list of projects. When you add or remove a
project from one, GitLab adds or removes the project from the other.
You can add up to 150 projects for GitLab to display on this dashboard.
