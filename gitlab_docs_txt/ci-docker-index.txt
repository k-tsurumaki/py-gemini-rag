You can incorporate
Docker
into your CI/CD workflow in two primary ways:
Run your CI/CD jobs
in Docker containers.
Create jobs to test, build, or publish applications that run in Docker containers.
For example, use a Node image from Docker Hub so your job runs in a container
with all the Node dependencies you need.
Use
Docker Build
or
BuildKit
to build Docker images.
Create jobs that build Docker images and publish them to a container registry.
BuildKit provides multiple approaches including rootless builds.
