History
Introduced as an
experimental feature
in GitLab 16.0,
with a flag
named
ci_namespace_catalog_experimental
. Disabled by default.
Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed
in GitLab 16.2.
Feature flag
ci_namespace_catalog_experimental
removed
in GitLab 16.3.
Moved
to
beta
in GitLab 16.6.
Made generally available
in GitLab 17.0.
A CI/CD component is a reusable single pipeline configuration unit. Use components
to create a small part of a larger pipeline, or even to compose a complete pipeline configuration.
A component can be configured with
input parameters
for more
dynamic behavior.
CI/CD components are similar to the other kinds of
configuration added with the
include
keyword
,
but have several advantages:
Components can be listed in the
CI/CD Catalog
.
Components can be released and used with a specific version.
Multiple components can be defined in the same project and versioned together.
Instead of creating your own components, you can also search for published components
that have the functionality you need in the
CI/CD Catalog
.
For an introduction and hands-on examples, see
Efficient DevSecOps workflows with reusable CI/CD components
.
For common questions and additional support, see the
FAQ: GitLab CI/CD Catalog
blog post.
Component project
History
The maximum number of components per project
changed
from 10 to 30 in GitLab 16.9.
The maximum number of components per project
changed
from 30 to 100 in GitLab 18.5.
A component project is a GitLab project with a repository that hosts one or more components.
All components in the project are versioned together, with a maximum of 30 components per project.
If a component requires different versioning from other components, the component should be moved
to a dedicated component project.
Create a component project
To create a component project, you must:
Create a new project
with a
README.md
file:
Ensure the description gives a clear introduction to the component.
Optional. After the project is created, you can
add a project avatar
.
Components published to the
CI/CD catalog
use both the description and avatar when displaying the component project’s summary.
Add a YAML configuration file for each component, following the
required directory structure
.
For example:
spec
:
inputs
:
stage
:
default
:
test
---
component-job
:
script
:
echo job 1
stage
:
$[[ inputs.stage ]]
You can
use the component
immediately, but you might want to consider
publishing the component to the
CI/CD catalog
.
Directory structure
The repository must contain:
A
README.md
Markdown file documenting the details of all the components in the repository.
A top level
templates/
directory that contains all the component configurations.
In this directory, you can:
Use single files ending in
.yml
for each component, like
templates/secret-detection.yml
.
Create subdirectories with a
template.yml
for each component,
like
templates/secret-detection/template.yml
. Only the
template.yml
file is used by other projects
using the component. Other files in these directories are not released with the component,
but can be used for things like tests or building container images.
Optionally, each component can also have its own
README.md
file that provides more detailed information, and can be linked from the top-level
README.md
file. This helps to provide a better overview of your component project and how to use it.
You should also:
Configure the project’s
.gitlab-ci.yml
to
test the components
and
release new versions
.
Add a
LICENSE.md
file with a license of your choice that covers the usage of your component.
For example the
MIT
or
Apache 2.0
open source licenses.
For example:
If the project contains a single component, the directory structure should be similar to:
├── templates/
│   └── my-component.yml
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
└── .gitlab-ci.yml
If the project contains multiple components, then the directory structure should be similar to:
├── templates/
│   ├── my-component.yml
│   └── my-other-component/
│       ├── template.yml
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       └── test.sh
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
└── .gitlab-ci.yml
In this example:
The
my-component
component’s configuration is defined in a single file.
The
my-other-component
component’s configuration contains multiple files in a directory.
Only the
template.yml
file can be used by other projects using the component.
Use a component
Prerequisites:
If you are a member of a parent group that contains the current group or project:
You must have the minimum role set by the visibility level of the project’s parent group. For example, you must have at least the Reporter role if a parent project is set to
Private
.
To add a component to a project’s CI/CD configuration, use the
include: component
keyword. The component reference is formatted as
<fully-qualified-domain-name>/<project-path>/<component-name>@<specific-version>
,
for example:
include
:
-
component
:
$CI_SERVER_FQDN/my-org/security-components/secret-detection@1.0.0
inputs
:
stage
:
build
In this example:
$CI_SERVER_FQDN
is a
predefined variable
for the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) matching the GitLab host.
You can only reference components in the same GitLab instance as your project.
my-org/security-components
is the full path of the project containing the component.
secret-detection
is the component name that is defined as either a single file
templates/secret-detection.yml
or as a directory
templates/secret-detection/
containing a
template.yml
.
1.0.0
is the
version
of the component.
Pipeline configuration and component configuration are not processed independently.
When a pipeline starts, any included component configuration
merges
into the pipeline’s configuration. If your pipeline and the component both contain configuration with the same name,
they can interact in unexpected ways.
For example, two jobs with the same name would merge together into a single job.
Similarly, a component using
extends
for configuration with the same name as a job in your pipeline
could extend the wrong configuration. Make sure your pipeline and the component do not share
any configuration with the same name, unless you intend to
override
the component’s configuration.
To use GitLab.com components on a GitLab Self-Managed instance, you must
mirror the component project
.
If a component requires the use of tokens, passwords, or other sensitive data to function,
be sure to audit the component’s source code to verify that the data is only used to
perform actions that you expect and authorize. You should also use tokens and secrets
with the minimum permissions, access, or scope required to complete the action.
Component versions
In order of highest priority first, the component version can be:
A commit SHA, for example
e3262fdd0914fa823210cdb79a8c421e2cef79d8
.
A tag, for example:
1.0.0
. If a tag and commit SHA exist with the same name,
the commit SHA takes precedence over the tag. Components released to the CI/CD Catalog
must be tagged with a
semantic version
.
A branch name, for example
main
. If a branch and tag exist with the same name,
the tag takes precedence over the branch.
~latest
or a partial semantic version, which selects the latest version within the specified pattern
published in the CI/CD Catalog. Use
~latest
only if you want to use the absolute
latest version at all times, which could include breaking changes.
~latest
does not include pre-releases, for example
1.0.1-rc
, which are not considered
production-ready.
You can use any version supported by the component, but using a version published
to the CI/CD catalog is recommended. The version referenced with a commit SHA or branch name
might not be published in the CI/CD catalog, but could be used for testing.
Partial semantic versions
History
Introduced
in GitLab 16.11
You can use partial semantic version numbers and the keyword
~latest
when referencing
a CI/CD catalog component to select the latest published version that matches your specification.
These formats only work with published CI/CD catalog components, not with regular project components.
This ensures that when you use formats like
1.2
or
~latest
, you only pull components that have been validated and published to the catalog, rather than potentially untested code from any repository.
This approach offers significant benefits for both consumers and authors of components:
For users, using partial versions is an excellent way to automatically receive
minor or patch updates without risking breaking changes from major releases. This ensures
your pipelines stay up-to-date with the latest bug fixes and security patches
while maintaining stability.
For component authors, partial version support allows major version releases
without risk of immediately breaking existing pipelines. Users who have
specified partial versions continue to use the latest compatible minor or patch version,
giving them time to update their pipelines at their own pace.
Use:
1.2
to select the latest
1.2.*
version
1
to select the latest
1.*.*
version
~latest
to select the latest released version
For example, a component has versions:
1.0.0
,
1.1.0
,
1.1.1
,
1.2.0
,
2.0.0
,
2.0.1
,
2.1.0
When referencing the component:
1
selects
1.2.0
1.1
selects
1.1.1
~latest
selects
2.1.0
Pre-release versions are never fetched when using partial version selection. To fetch
a pre-release version, specify the full version, for example
1.0.1-rc
.
Use component context in components
History
Introduced
in GitLab 18.6 as a
beta
with a flag
named
ci_component_context_interpolation
. Enabled by default.
Components can access metadata about themselves with a component context
CI/CD expression
.
Use this expression in component templates to reference the version, commit SHA, and other
metadata dynamically.
To use component context in a component, you must:
Declare which component context fields the component needs in the
spec:component
header.
spec:component
supports
name
,
sha
,
version
, and
reference
fields.
Reference the context fields using the CI/CD expression
$[[ component.field-name ]]
in the component template.
For example, a component that references a Docker image built with the same version:
spec
:
component
:
[
name, version, reference]
inputs
:
image_tag
:
default
:
latest
---
build-image
:
image
:
registry.example.com/$[[ component.name ]]:$[[ component.version ]]
script
:
-
echo "Building with component version $[[ component.version ]]"
-
echo "Component reference: $[[ component.reference ]]"
You can also use component context to
reference versioned resources
.
Write a component
This section describes some best practices for creating high quality component projects.
Manage dependencies
While it’s possible for a component to use other components in turn, make sure to carefully select the dependencies. To manage dependencies, you should:
Keep dependencies to a minimum. A small amount of duplication is usually better than having dependencies.
Rely on local dependencies whenever possible. For example, using
include:local
is a good way
to ensure the same Git SHA is used across multiple files.
When depending on components from other projects, pin their version to a release from the catalog rather than using moving target
versions such as
~latest
or a Git reference. Using a release or Git SHA guarantees that you are fetching the same revision
all the time and that consumers of your component get consistent behavior.
Update your dependencies regularly by pinning them to newer releases. Then publish a new release of your components with updated
dependencies.
Evaluate the permissions of dependencies, and use dependencies that require the least amount of permissions.
For example, if you need to build an image, consider using
Buildah
instead of Docker, so that you don’t
require a Runner with a privileged Docker daemon.
Write a clear
README.md
Each component project should have clear and comprehensive documentation. To
write a good
README.md
file:
Start with a summary of the capabilities that the components provide.
If the project contains multiple components, use a
table of contents
to help users quickly jump to a specific component’s details.
Add a
## Components
section with sub-sections like
### Component A
for each component.
In each component section:
Describe what the component does.
Add at least one YAML example showing how to use it.
Use
spec:inputs:description
to
document any variables or secrets the component uses.
Do not duplicate input documentation in the
README
. Inputs appear automatically on the component page.
Instead, link to the published component.
Add a
## Contribute
section if contributions are welcome.
If a component needs more instructions, add additional documentation in a Markdown file
in the component directory and link to it from the main
README.md
file. For example:
README.md    # with links to the specific docs.md
templates/
├── component-1/
│   ├── template.yml
│   └── docs.md
└── component-2/
├── template.yml
└── docs.md
For an example, see the
AWS components README
.
Test the component
Testing CI/CD components as part of the development workflow is strongly recommended
and helps ensure consistent behavior.
Test changes in a CI/CD pipeline (like any other project) by creating a
.gitlab-ci.yml
in the root directory. Make sure to test both the behavior and potential side-effects
of the component. You can use the
GitLab API
if needed.
For example:
include
:
# include the component located in the current project from the current SHA
-
component
:
$CI_SERVER_FQDN/$CI_PROJECT_PATH/my-component@$CI_COMMIT_SHA
inputs
:
stage
:
build
stages
:
[
build, test, release]
# Check if `component job of my-component` is added.
# This example job could also test that the included component works as expected.
# You can inspect data generated by the component, use GitLab API endpoints, or third-party tools.
ensure-job-added
:
stage
:
test
image
:
badouralix/curl-jq
# Replace "component job of my-component" with the job name in your component.
script
:
-
|
route="${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/pipelines/${CI_PIPELINE_ID}/jobs"
count=`curl --silent --header "JOB-TOKEN: ${CI_JOB_TOKEN}" "$route" | jq 'map(select(.name | contains("component job of my-component"))) | length'`
if [ "$count" != "1" ]; then
exit 1; else
echo "Component Job present"
fi
# If the pipeline is for a new tag with a semantic version, and all previous jobs succeed,
# create the release.
create-release
:
stage
:
release
image
:
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli:latest
script
:
echo "Creating release $CI_COMMIT_TAG"
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_TAG
release
:
tag_name
:
$CI_COMMIT_TAG
description
:
"Release $CI_COMMIT_TAG of components repository $CI_PROJECT_PATH"
After committing and pushing changes, the pipeline tests the component, then creates
a release if the earlier jobs pass.
Authentication is necessary if the project is private.
Test a component against sample files
In some cases, components require source files to interact with. For example, a component
that builds Go source code likely needs some samples of Go to test against. Alternatively,
a component that builds Docker images likely needs some sample Dockerfiles to test against.
You can include sample files like these directly in the component project, to be used
during component testing.
You can learn more in
examples for testing a component
.
Avoid hard-coding instance or project-specific values
When
using another component
in your component, use
$CI_SERVER_FQDN
instead of your instance’s Fully Qualified Domain Name (like
gitlab.com
).
When accessing the GitLab API in your component, use the
$CI_API_V4_URL
instead of the
full URL and path for your instance (like
https://gitlab.com/api/v4
).
These
predefined variables
ensure that your component also works when used on another instance, for example when using
a GitLab.com component on a GitLab Self-Managed instance
.
Do not assume API resources are always public
Ensure that the component and its testing pipeline work also
on GitLab Self-Managed
.
While some API resources of public projects on GitLab.com could be accessed via unauthenticated requests
on a GitLab Self-Managed instance a component project could be mirrored as private or internal project.
It’s important that an access token can optionally be provided via inputs or variables to
authenticate requests on GitLab Self-Managed instances.
Avoid using global keywords
Avoid using
global keywords
in a component.
Using these keywords in a component affects all jobs in a pipeline, including jobs
directly defined in the main
.gitlab-ci.yml
or in other included components.
As an alternative to global keywords:
Add the configuration directly to each job, even if it creates some duplication
in the component configuration.
Use the
extends
keyword in the component, but use
unique names that reduce the risk of naming conflicts when the component is merged
into the configuration.
For example, avoid using the
default
global keyword:
# Not recommended
default
:
image
:
ruby:3.0
rspec-1
:
script
:
bundle exec rspec dir1/
rspec-2
:
script
:
bundle exec rspec dir2/
Instead, you can:
Add the configuration to each job explicitly:
rspec-1
:
image
:
ruby:3.0
script
:
bundle exec rspec dir1/
rspec-2
:
image
:
ruby:3.0
script
:
bundle exec rspec dir2/
Use
extends
to reuse configuration:
.rspec-image
:
image
:
ruby:3.0
rspec-1
:
extends
:
-
.rspec-image
script
:
bundle exec rspec dir1/
rspec-2
:
extends
:
-
.rspec-image
script
:
bundle exec rspec dir2/
Replace hardcoded values with inputs
Avoid using hardcoded values in CI/CD components. Hardcoded values might force
component users to need to review the component’s internal details and adapt their pipeline
to work with the component.
A common keyword with problematic hard-coded values is
stage
. If a component job’s
stage is hardcoded, all pipelines using the component
must
either define
the exact same stage, or
override
the configuration.
The preferred method is to use the
input
keyword
for dynamic
component configuration. The component user can specify the exact value they need.
For example, to create a component with
stage
configuration that can be defined by users:
In the component configuration:
spec
:
inputs
:
stage
:
default
:
test
---
unit-test
:
stage
:
$[[ inputs.stage ]]
script
:
echo unit tests
integration-test
:
stage
:
$[[ inputs.stage ]]
script
:
echo integration tests
In a project using the component:
stages
:
[
verify, release]
include
:
-
component
:
$CI_SERVER_FQDN/myorg/ruby/test@1.0.0
inputs
:
stage
:
verify
Define job names with inputs
Similar to the values for the
stage
keyword, you should avoid hard-coding job names
in CI/CD components. When your component’s users can customize job names, they can prevent conflicts
with the existing names in their pipelines. Users could also include a component
multiple times with different input options by using different names.
Use
inputs
to allow your component’s users to define a specific job name, or a prefix for the
job name. For example:
spec
:
inputs
:
job-prefix
:
description
:
"Define a prefix for the job name"
job-name
:
description
:
"Alternatively, define the job's name"
job-stage
:
default
:
test
---
"$[[ inputs.job-prefix ]]-scan-website"
:
stage
:
$[[ inputs.job-stage ]]
script
:
-
scan-website-1
"$[[ inputs.job-name ]]"
:
stage
:
$[[ inputs.job-stage ]]
script
:
-
scan-website-2
Replace custom CI/CD variables with inputs
When using CI/CD variables in a component, evaluate if the
inputs
keyword
should be used instead. Avoid asking users to define custom variables to configure
components when
inputs
is a better solution.
Inputs are explicitly defined in the component’s
spec
section, and have better validation than variables.
For example, if a required input is not passed to the component, GitLab returns a pipeline error.
By contrast, if a variable is not defined, its value is empty, and there is no error.
For example, use
inputs
instead of variables to configure a scanner’s output format:
In the component configuration:
spec
:
inputs
:
scanner-output
:
default
:
json
---
my-scanner
:
script
:
my-scan --output $[[ inputs.scanner-output ]]
In the project using the component:
include
:
-
component
:
$CI_SERVER_FQDN/path/to/project/my-scanner@1.0.0
inputs
:
scanner-output
:
yaml
In other cases, CI/CD variables might still be preferred. For example:
Use
predefined variables
to automatically configure
a component to match a user’s project.
Ask users to store sensitive values as
masked or protected CI/CD variables in project settings
.
CI/CD Catalog
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
History
Introduced
as an
experiment
in GitLab 16.1.
Moved
to
beta
in GitLab 16.7.
Made Generally Available
in GitLab 17.0.
The
CI/CD Catalog
is a list of projects with published CI/CD components you can use
to extend your CI/CD workflow.
Anyone can
create a component project
and add it to
the CI/CD Catalog, or contribute to an existing project to improve the available components.
For a click-through demo, see
the CI/CD Catalog beta Product Tour
.
View the CI/CD Catalog
To access the CI/CD Catalog and view the published components that are available to you:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Explore
.
Select
CI/CD Catalog
.
Alternatively, if you are already in the
pipeline editor
in your project, you can select
CI/CD Catalog
.
Visibility of components in the CI/CD catalog follows the component source project’s
visibility setting
. Components with source projects set to:
Private are visible only to users assigned at least the Guest role for the source component project. To use a component, you must have at least the Reporter role.
Internal are visible only to users logged into the GitLab instance.
Public are visible to anyone with access to the GitLab instance.
Publish a component project
To publish a component project in the CI/CD catalog, you must:
Set the project as a catalog project.
Publish a new release.
Set a component project as a catalog project
To make published versions of a component project visible in the CI/CD catalog,
you must set the project as a catalog project.
Prerequisites:
You must have the Owner role for the project.
To set the project as a catalog project:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Settings
>
General
.
Expand
Visibility, project features, permissions
.
Turn on the
CI/CD Catalog project
toggle.
The project only becomes findable in the catalog after you publish a new release.
To use automation to enable this setting, you can use the
mutationcatalogresourcescreate
GraphQL endpoint.
Issue 463043
proposes to expose this in the REST API as well.
Publish a new release
CI/CD components can be
used
without being listed in the CI/CD catalog.
However, publishing a component’s releases in the catalog makes it discoverable to other users.
Prerequisites:
You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.
The project must:
Be set as a
catalog project
.
Have a
project description
defined.
Have a
README.md
file in the root directory for the commit SHA of the tag being released.
Have at least one
CI/CD component in the
templates/
directory
for the commit SHA of the tag being released.
You must use the
release
keyword
in a CI/CD job to create the release,
not the
Releases API
.
To publish a new version of the component to the catalog:
Add a job to the project’s
.gitlab-ci.yml
file that uses the
release
keyword to create the new release when a tag is created.
You should configure the tag pipeline to
test the components
before
running the release job. For example:
create-release
:
stage
:
release
image
:
registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli:latest
script
:
echo "Creating release $CI_COMMIT_TAG"
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_TAG
release
:
tag_name
:
$CI_COMMIT_TAG
description
:
"Release $CI_COMMIT_TAG of components in $CI_PROJECT_PATH"
Create a
new tag
for the release,
which should trigger a tag pipeline that contains the job responsible for creating the release.
The tag must use
semantic versioning
.
After the release job completes successfully, the release is created and the new version
is published to the CI/CD catalog.
Semantic versioning
History
Introduced
in GitLab 16.10.
When tagging and
releasing new versions
of components to the Catalog,
you must use
semantic versioning
. Semantic versioning is the standard
for communicating that a change is a major, minor, patch, or other kind of change.
For example,
1.0.0
,
2.3.4
, and
1.0.0-alpha
are all valid semantic versions.
Unpublish a component project
To remove a component project from the catalog, turn off the
CI/CD Catalog resource
toggle in the project settings.
This action destroys the metadata about the component project and its versions published
in the catalog. The project and its repository still exist, but are not visible in the catalog.
To publish the component project in the catalog again, you need to
publish a new release
.
Verified component creators
History
Introduced for GitLab.com
in GitLab 16.11
Introduced for GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated
in GitLab 18.1
Some CI/CD components are badged with an icon to show that the component was created
and is maintained by users verified by GitLab or the instance administrator:
GitLab-maintained (
tanuki-verified
): GitLab.com components that are created and maintained by GitLab.
GitLab Partner (
partner-verified
): GitLab.com components that are independently created
and maintained by a GitLab-verified partner.
GitLab partners can contact a member of the GitLab Partner Alliance to have their
namespace on GitLab.com flagged as GitLab-verified. Then any CI/CD components located in the
namespace are badged as GitLab Partner components. The Partner Alliance member
creates an
internal request issue (GitLab team members only)
on behalf of the verified partner.
GitLab Partner-created components are provided
as-is
, without warranty of any kind.
An end user’s use of a GitLab Partner-created component is at their own risk and
GitLab shall have no indemnification obligations nor any liability of any type
with respect to the end user’s use of the component. The end user’s use of such content
and any liability related thereto shall be between the publisher of the content and the end user.

in GitLab 18.1
A GitLab administrator can set a CI/CD component as created and maintained by a verified creator:
Open GraphiQL in the instance with your administrator account, for example at:
https://gitlab.example.com/-/graphql-explorer
.
Run this query, replacing
root-level-group
with the root namespace of the component to verify:
mutation
{
verifiedNamespaceCreate

"root-level-group"
,
verificationLevel

}
After the query completes, all components in projects in the root namespace are verified.
The
Verified creator
badge displays next to the component names in the CI/CD catalog.
To remove the badge from a component, repeat the query with
UNVERIFIED

Convert a CI/CD template to a component
Any existing CI/CD template that you use in projects by using the
include:
syntax
can be converted to a CI/CD component:
Decide if you want the component to be grouped with other components as part of
an existing
component project
, or
create a new component project
.
Create a YAML file in the component project according to the
directory structure
.
Copy the content of the original template YAML file into the new component YAML file.
Refactor the new component’s configuration to:
Follow the guidance on
writing a component
.
Improve the configuration, for example by enabling
merge request pipelines
or making it
more efficient
.
Leverage the
.gitlab-ci.yml
in the components repository to
test changes to the component
.
Tag and
release the component
.
You can learn more by following a practical example for
migrating the Go CI/CD template to CI/CD component
.
Use a GitLab.com component on GitLab Self-Managed
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
The CI/CD catalog of a fresh install of a GitLab instance starts with no published CI/CD components.
To populate your instance’s catalog, you can:
Publish your own components
.
Mirror components from GitLab.com in your GitLab Self-Managed instance.
To mirror a GitLab.com component in your GitLab Self-Managed instance:
Make sure that
network outbound requests
are allowed for
gitlab.com
.
Create a group
to host the component projects (recommended group:
components
).
Create a mirror of the component project
in the new group.
Write a
project description
for the component project mirror because mirroring repositories does not copy the description.
Set the self-hosted component project as a catalog resource
.
Publish
a new release
in the self-hosted component project by
running a pipeline
for a tag (usually the latest tag).
CI/CD component security best practices
For component users
As anyone can publish components to the catalog, you should carefully review components before using them in your project.
Use of GitLab CI/CD components is at your own risk and GitLab cannot guarantee the security of third-party components.
When using third-party CI/CD components, consider the following security best practices:
Audit and review component source code
: Carefully examine the code to ensure it’s free of malicious content.
Minimize access to credentials and tokens
:
Audit the component’s source code to verify that any credentials or tokens are only used
to perform actions that you expect and authorize.
Use minimally scoped access tokens.
Avoid using long-lived access tokens or credentials.
Audit use of credentials and tokens used by CI/CD components.
Use pinned versions
: Pin CI/CD components to a specific commit SHA (preferred)
or release version tag to ensure the integrity of the component used in a pipeline.
Only use release tags if you trust the component maintainer. Avoid using
latest
.
Store secrets securely
: Do not store secrets in CI/CD configuration files.
Avoid storing secrets and credentials in project settings if you can use an external secret management
solution instead.
Use ephemeral, isolated runner environments
: Run component jobs in temporary,
isolated environments when possible. Be aware of
security risks
with self-managed runners.
Securely handle cache and artifacts
: Do not pass cache or artifacts from other jobs
in your pipeline to CI/CD component jobs unless absolutely necessary.
Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access
: Restrict
CI/CD job token (
CI_JOB_TOKEN
) project access and permissions
for projects using CI/CD components.
Review CI/CD component changes
: Carefully review all changes to the CI/CD component configuration
before changing to use an updated commit SHA or release tag for the component.
Audit custom container images
: Carefully review any custom container images used by the CI/CD component
to ensure they are free of malicious content.
For component maintainers
To maintain secure and trustworthy CI/CD components and ensure the integrity of the pipeline configuration
you deliver to users, follow these best practices:
Use two-factor authentication (2FA)
: Ensure all CI/CD component project maintainers
and owners have
2FA enabled
,
or enforce
2FA for all users in the group
.
Use protected branches
:
Use
protected branches
for component project releases.
Protect the default branch, and protect all release branches
using wildcard rules
.
Require everyone submit merge requests for changes to protected branches. Set the
Allowed to push and merge
option to
No one
for protected branches.
Block force pushes to protected branches.
Sign all commits
:
Sign all commits
to the component project.
Discourage using
latest
: Avoid including examples in your
README.md
that use
@latest
.
Limit dependency on caches and artifacts from other jobs
: Only use cache and artifacts
from other jobs in CI/CD components if absolutely necessary
Update CI/CD component dependencies
: Check for and apply updates to dependencies regularly.
Review changes carefully
:
Carefully review all changes to the CI/CD component pipeline configuration before
merging into default or release branches.
Use
merge request approvals
for all user-facing changes to CI/CD component catalog projects.
Troubleshooting
content not found
message
You might receive an error message similar to the following when using the
~latest
or a partial semantic
version qualifier to reference a component hosted by a
catalog project
:
This GitLab CI configuration is invalid: Component 'gitlab.com/my-namespace/my-project/my-component@~latest' - content not found
The
~latest
behavior
was updated
in GitLab 16.10. It now refers to the latest semantic version of the catalog resource. To resolve this issue,
create a new release
.
Error:
Build component error: Spec must be a valid json schema
If a component has invalid formatting, you might not be able to create a release
and could receive an error like
Build component error: Spec must be a valid json schema
.
This error can be caused by an empty
spec:inputs
section. If your configuration
does not use any inputs, you can make the
spec
section empty instead. For example:
spec
:
---
my-component
:
script
:
echo
