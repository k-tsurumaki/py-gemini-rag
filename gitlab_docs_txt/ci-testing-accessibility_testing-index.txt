If your application offers a web interface, you can use
GitLab CI/CD
to determine the accessibility
impact of pending code changes.
Pa11y
is a free and open source tool for
measuring the accessibility of web sites. GitLab integrates Pa11y into a
CI/CD job template
.
The
a11y
job analyzes a defined set of web pages and reports
accessibility violations, warnings, and notices in a file named
accessibility
.
Pa11y uses
WCAG 2.1 rules
.

You can run Pa11y with GitLab CI/CD using the
GitLab Accessibility Docker image

Add the following configuration to your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file.

:
"Verify/Accessibility.gitlab-ci.yml"
Customize the
a11y_urls
variable to list the URLs of the web pages to test with Pa11y.
The
a11y
job in your CI/CD pipeline generates these files:
One HTML report per URL listed in the
a11y_urls
variable.
One file containing the collected report data. This
file is named
gl-accessibility.json
.
You can
view job artifacts in your browser

The job definition provided by the template does not support Kubernetes.
You cannot pass configurations into Pa11y via CI configuration.
To change the configuration, edit a copy of the template in your CI file.
