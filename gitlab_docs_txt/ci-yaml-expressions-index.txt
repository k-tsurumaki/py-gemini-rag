CI/CD expressions
CI/CD expressions enable dynamic configuration in your CI/CD pipelines by referencing variables and inputs in specialized contexts.
GitLab evaluates expressions in the pipeline configuration before the pipeline is created.
Configuration expressions
Configuration expressions use the
$[[ ]]
syntax and are evaluated at pipeline creation time (compile-time).
They enable dynamic configuration based on different contexts.
All configuration expressions share these characteristics:
Compile-time evaluation
: Values are resolved when the pipeline configuration is created,
not during job execution. A large number of expressions can increase pipeline creation time,
but does not affect job execution time.
Static resolution
: Cannot perform dynamic logic or access runtime job state.
Configuration expressions support different contexts for accessing values:
Context
Syntax
Availability
Purpose
Inputs context
$[[ inputs.INPUT_NAME ]]
GitLab 17.0
Reference CI/CD inputs in reusable configurations.
Matrix context
$[[ matrix.IDENTIFIER ]]
GitLab 18.6 (Beta)
Reference
parallel:matrix
identifiers in job dependencies.
Component context
$[[ component.FIELD_NAME ]]
GitLab 18.6 (Beta)
Reference component metadata in component templates.
Inputs context
History
Introduced
in GitLab 15.11 as a beta feature.
Made generally available
in GitLab 17.0.
Use the
inputs.
context to reference
CI/CD inputs
in reusable configurations
using
$[[ inputs.INPUT_NAME ]]
syntax.
For example:
spec
:
inputs
:
environment
:
default
:
production
job-stage
:
default
:
test
---
scan-website
:
stage
:
$[[ inputs.job-stage ]]
script
:
./scan-website $[[ inputs.environment ]]
input.
expressions have the following characteristics:
Type validation: Supports
string
,
number
,
boolean
, and
array
types with validation.
Input validation prevents pipeline creation with invalid values.
Function support: Predefined functions like
expand_vars
and
truncate
can manipulate values.
Scope: Available in the file where defined, or passed explicitly with
include:inputs
.
Matrix context
History
Introduced
in GitLab 18.6. This feature is in
beta
.
Use the
matrix.
context
to reference
parallel:matrix
values by using a
$[[ matrix.IDENTIFIER ]]
syntax. Use it in job dependencies to enable
dynamic 1:1 mappings between
parallel:matrix
jobs.
For example:
.os-arch-matrix
:
parallel
:
matrix
:
-
OS
:
[
ubuntu, alpine]
ARCH
:
[
amd64, arm64]
build
:
script
:
echo "Testing $OS on $ARCH"
parallel
:
!
reference [.os-arch-matrix, parallel]
test
:
script
:
echo "Testing $OS on $ARCH"
parallel
:
!
reference [.os-arch-matrix, parallel]
needs
:
-
job
:
build
parallel
:
matrix
:
-
OS
:
[
'$[[ matrix.OS ]]'
]
ARCH
:
[
'$[[ matrix.ARCH ]]'
]
matrix.
expressions have the following characteristics:
Scoped to job-level
parallel:matrix
: Only values from the current job can be referenced.
Automatic mapping: Creates 1:1 dependencies between matrix jobs across stages
Component context
History
Introduced
in GitLab 18.6 as a
beta
with a flag
named
ci_component_context_interpolation
. Enabled by default.
Use the
component.
context to reference
CI/CD component
metadata
in component templates using
$[[ component.FIELD_NAME ]]
syntax.
Component context provides metadata about the component itself, such as its name, version,
and the commit SHA. This allows component templates to reference their own metadata dynamically.
To use component context, declare which fields are needed in the
spec:component
header, then reference them in the component template.
For example:
spec
:
component
:
[
name, version]
inputs
:
image_tag
:
default
:
latest
---
build-job
:
image
:
registry.example.com/$[[ component.name ]]:$[[ component.version ]]
script
:
-
echo "Building with component version $[[ component.version ]]"
