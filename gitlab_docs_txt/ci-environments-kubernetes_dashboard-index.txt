You can review the sync status of your Flux deployments from a dashboard.
To display the deployment status, your dashboard must be able to retrieve the
Kustomization
and
HelmRelease
resources,
which requires a namespace to be configured for the environment.
GitLab searches the
Kustomization
and
HelmRelease
resources specified by the
Flux resource
dropdown list in the environment settings.
A dashboard displays one of the following status badges:
Status
Description
Reconciled
The deployment successfully reconciled with its environment.
Reconciling
A reconciliation is in progress.
Stalled
A reconciliation is stuck because of an error that cannot be resolved without human intervention.
Failed
The deployment couldn’t reconcile because of an unrecoverable error.
Unknown
The sync status of the deployment couldn’t be retrieved.
Unavailable
The
Kustomization
or
HelmRelease
resource couldn’t be retrieved.

A GitLab agent for Kubernetes is
configured
and shared with the environment’s project, or its parent group, using the
user_access
keyword.
The detailed dashboard is not linked from the sidebar navigation.

Find your agent for Kubernetes ID:
On the left sidebar, select
Search or go to
and find your project. If you’ve
turned on the new navigation
, this field is on the top bar.
Select
Operate
>
Kubernetes clusters
.
Copy the numerical ID of the agent you want to access.
Go to one of the following URLs, replacing
<agent_id>
with your agent ID:
Resource type

Pods
https://myinstance.gitlab.com/-/kubernetes/<agent_id>/pods
Services
https://myinstance.gitlab.com/-/kubernetes/<agent_id>/services
Deployments
https://myinstance.gitlab.com/-/kubernetes/<agent_id>/deployments
ReplicaSets

Troubleshooting
When working with the dashboard for Kubernetes, you might encounter the following issues.
User cannot list resource in API group
You might get an error that states
Error: services is forbidden: User "gitlab:user:<user-name>" cannot list resource "<resource-name>" in API group "" at the cluster scope
.
This error happens when a user is not allowed to do the specified operation in the
Kubernetes RBAC
.
To resolve, check your
RBAC configuration
. If the RBAC is properly configured, contact your Kubernetes administrator.
GitLab agent dropdown list is empty
When you configure a new environment, the
GitLab agent
dropdown list might be empty, even if you have configured Kubernetes clusters.
To populate the
GitLab agent
dropdown list, grant an agent Kubernetes access with the
user_access
keyword.
