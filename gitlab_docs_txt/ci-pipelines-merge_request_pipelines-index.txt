Merge request pipelines
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
You can configure your pipeline to run every time you make changes to the
source branch in a merge request.
This type of pipeline, called a merge request pipeline, runs when you:
Create a new merge request from a source branch that has one or more commits.
Push a new commit to the source branch for a merge request.
Go to the
Pipelines
tab in a merge request and select
Run pipeline
.
In addition, merge request pipelines:
Have access to
more predefined variables
.
Can
optionally access protected variables or runners
.
These pipelines display a
merge request
label in pipeline lists.
Merge request pipelines run on the contents of the source branch only, ignoring the content
of the target branch. To run a pipeline that tests the result of merging the source
and target branches together, use merged results pipelines.
Prerequisites
To use merge request pipelines:
Your project’s
.gitlab-ci.yml
file must be
configured with jobs that run in merge request pipelines
.
You must have at least the Developer role for the
source project to run a merge request pipeline.
Your repository must be a GitLab repository, not an
external repository
.
Add jobs to merge request pipelines
Use the
rules
keyword to configure jobs to run in
merge request pipelines. For example:
job1
:
script
:
-
echo "This job runs in merge request pipelines"
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
You can also use the
workflow: rules
keyword
to configure the entire pipeline to run in merge request pipelines. For example:
workflow
:
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
job1
:
script
:
-
echo "This job runs in merge request pipelines"
job2
:
script
:
-
echo "This job also runs in merge request pipelines"
For common
workflow
examples, see:

Git Flow with merge request pipelines
To
use security scanning tools with merge request pipelines
,
use the CI/CD variable
AST_ENABLE_MR_PIPELINES
or the
latest
template edition.
Use with forked projects
External contributors who work in forks can’t create pipelines in the parent project.
A merge request from a fork that is submitted to the parent project triggers a
pipeline that:
Is created and runs in the fork (source) project, not the parent (target) project.
Uses the fork project’s CI/CD configuration, resources, and project CI/CD variables.
Pipelines for forks display with the
fork
badge in the parent project.
Run pipelines in the parent project
Project members in the parent project can trigger a merge request pipeline
for a merge request submitted from a fork project. This pipeline:
Is created and runs in the parent (target) project, not the fork (source) project.
Uses the CI/CD configuration present in the fork project’s branch.
Uses the parent project’s CI/CD settings, resources, and project CI/CD variables.
Uses the permissions of the parent project member that triggers the pipeline.
Run pipelines in fork project MRs to ensure that the post-merge pipeline passes in
the parent project. Additionally, if you do not trust the fork project’s runner,
running the pipeline in the parent project uses the parent project’s trusted runners.
Fork merge requests can contain malicious code that tries to steal secrets in the parent project
when the pipeline runs, even before merge. As a reviewer, carefully check the changes
in the merge request before triggering the pipeline. Unless you trigger the pipeline
through the API or the
/rebase
quick action
,
GitLab shows a warning that you must accept before the pipeline runs. Otherwise,
no warning displays
.
Prerequisites:
The parent project’s
.gitlab-ci.yml
file must be configured to
run jobs in merge request pipelines
.
You must be a member of the parent project with
permissions to run CI/CD pipelines
.
You might need additional permissions if the branch is protected.
The fork project must be
visible
to the
user running the pipeline. Otherwise, the
Pipelines
tab does not display
in the merge request.
To use the UI to run a pipeline in the parent project for a merge request from a fork project:
In the merge request, go to the
Pipelines
tab.
Select
Run pipeline
. You must read and accept the warning, or the pipeline does not run.
Prevent pipelines from fork projects
To prevent users from running new pipelines for fork projects in the parent project
use
the projects API
to disable the
ci_allow_fork_pipelines_to_run_in_parent_project
setting.
Pipelines created before the setting was disabled are not affected and continue to run.
If you rerun a job in an older pipeline, the job uses the same context as when the
pipeline was originally created.
Available predefined variables
When you use merge request pipelines, you can use:
All the same
predefined variables
that are
available in branch pipelines.
Additional predefined variables
available only to jobs in merge request pipelines.
Control access to protected variables and runners
History
Introduced
in GitLab 18.1
You can control access to
protected CI/CD variables
and
protected runners
from merge request pipelines.
Merge request pipelines can only access these protected resources if both the source and target branches
of the merge request are
protected
. Also, the user triggering the pipeline should have push/merge access to the target branch of the Merge Request. Merge request pipelines can only access these protected resources if both the source and target branches belong to the same project. Merge request pipelines from a fork of a repository cannot access these protected resources.
Prerequisites:
You must have the Maintainer role in the project.
To control access to protected variables and runners:
Go to
Settings
>
CI/CD
.
Expand
Variables
Under
Access protected resources in merge request pipelines
, select or clear
the
Allow merge request pipelines to access protected variables and runners
option.
