If you’re migrating from TeamCity to GitLab CI/CD, you can create CI/CD
pipelines that replicate and enhance your TeamCity workflows.
Key similarities and differences
GitLab CI/CD and TeamCity are CI/CD tools with some similarities. Both GitLab and TeamCity:
Are flexible enough to run jobs for most languages.
Can be deployed either on-premises or in the cloud.
Additionally, there are some important differences between the two:
GitLab CI/CD pipelines are configured in a YAML format configuration file, which
you can edit manually or with the
pipeline editor
.
TeamCity pipelines can be configured from the UI or using Kotlin DSL.
GitLab is a DevSecOps platform with built-in SCM, container registry, security scanning, and more.
TeamCity requires separate solutions for these capabilities, usually provided by integrations.
Configuration file
TeamCity can be
configured from the UI
or in the
Teamcity Configuration
file in the Kotlin DSL format
.
A TeamCity build configuration is a set of instructions that defines how a software project should be built,
tested, and deployed. The configuration includes parameters and settings necessary for automating
the CI/CD process in TeamCity.
In GitLab, the equivalent of a TeamCity build configuration is the
.gitlab-ci.yml
file.
This file defines the CI/CD pipeline for a project, specifying the stages, jobs,
and commands needed to build, test, and deploy the project.
Comparison of features and concepts
Many TeamCity features and concepts have equivalents in GitLab that offer the same
functionality.
Jobs
TeamCity uses build configurations, which consist of multiple build steps where you define
commands or scripts to execute tasks such as compiling code, running tests, and packaging artifacts.
The following is an example of a TeamCity project configuration in a Kotlin DSL format that builds a Docker file and runs unit tests:
package
_Self.buildTypes
import
jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.*
import
jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.buildFeatures.perfmon
import
jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.buildSteps.dockerCommand
import
jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.buildSteps.nodeJS
import
jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.triggers.vcs
object
BuildTest
:
BuildType
({
name
=
"Build & Test"
vcs
{
root
(
HttpsGitlabComRutshahCicdDemoGitRefsHeadsMain
)
}
steps
{
dockerCommand
{
id
=
"DockerCommand"
commandType
=
build
{
source
=
file
{
path
=
"Dockerfile"
}
}
}
nodeJS
{
id
=
"nodejs_runner"
workingDir
=
"app"
shellScript
=
"""
npm install jest-teamcity --no-save
npm run test -- --reporters=jest-teamcity
"""
.
trimIndent
()
}
}
triggers
{
vcs
{
}
}
features
{
perfmon
{
}
}
})
In GitLab CI/CD, you define jobs with the tasks to execute as part of the pipeline.
Each job can have one or more build steps defined in it.
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file for the previous example would be:
workflow
:
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH != "main" || $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE != "merge_request_event"
when
:
never
-
when
:

stages

npm install

Pipeline triggers
TeamCity Triggers
define conditions that initiate a build, including VCS changes,
scheduled triggers, or builds triggered by other builds.
In GitLab CI/CD, pipelines can be triggered automatically for various events, like changes to branches or merge requests and new tags. Pipelines can also be triggered manually, using an
API
, or with
scheduled pipelines
. For more information, see
CI/CD pipelines
.
Variables
In TeamCity, you
define build parameters and environment variables
in the build configuration settings.
In GitLab, use the
variables
keyword to define
CI/CD variables
.
Use variables to reuse configuration data, have more dynamic configuration, or store important values.
Variables can be defined either globally or per job.
For example, a GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file that uses variables:
default
:
image
:
alpine:latest
stages
:
-
greet
variables
:
NAME
:
"Fern"
english
:
stage
:
greet
variables
:
GREETING
:
"Hello"
script
:
-
echo "$GREETING $NAME"
spanish
:
stage
:
greet
variables
:
GREETING
:
"Hola"
script
:
-
echo "$GREETING $NAME"
Artifacts
Build configurations in TeamCity allow you to define
artifacts
generated during the build process.
In GitLab, any job can use the
artifacts
keyword to define a set of artifacts to
be stored when a job completes.
Artifacts
are files that can be used in later jobs,
for testing or deployment.
For example, a GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file that uses artifacts:
stage
:
-
generate
-
use
generate_cat
:
stage
:
generate
script
:
-
touch cat.txt
-
echo "meow" > cat.txt
artifacts
:
paths
:
-
cat.txt
expire_in
:
1
week
use_cat
:
stage
:
use
script
:
-
cat cat.txt
Runners
The equivalent of
TeamCity agents
in GitLab are Runners.
In GitLab CI/CD, runners are the services that execute jobs. If you are using GitLab.com, you can use the
instance runner fleet
to run jobs without provisioning your own self-managed runners.
Some key details about runners:
Runners can be
configured
to be shared across an instance,
a group, or dedicated to a single project.
You can use the
tags
keyword
for finer control, and associate runners with specific jobs. For example, you can use a tag for jobs that
require dedicated, more powerful, or specific hardware.
GitLab has
autoscaling for runners
.
Use autoscaling to provision runners only when needed and scale down when not needed.
TeamCity build features & plugins
Some functionality in TeamCity that is enabled through build features & plugins
is supported in GitLab CI/CD natively with CI/CD keywords and features.
TeamCity plugin
GitLab feature
Code coverage
Code coverage
and
Test coverage visualization
Unit Test Report
JUnit test report artifacts
and
Unit test reports
Notifications
Notification emails
and
Slack
Planning and performing a migration
The following list of recommended steps was created after observing organizations
that were able to quickly complete a migration to GitLab CI/CD.
Create a migration plan
Before starting a migration you should create a
migration plan
to make preparations for the migration.
For a migration from TeamCity, ask yourself the following questions in preparation:
What plugins are used by jobs in TeamCity today?
Do you know what these plugins do exactly?
What is installed on the TeamCity agents?
Are there any shared libraries in use?
How are you authenticating from TeamCity? Are you using SSH keys, API tokens, or other secrets?
Are there other projects that you need to access from your pipeline?
Are there credentials in TeamCity to access outside services? For example Ansible Tower,
Artifactory, or other Cloud Providers or deployment targets?
Prerequisites
Before doing any migration work, you should first:
Get familiar with GitLab.
Read about the
key GitLab CI/CD features
.
Follow tutorials to create
your first GitLab pipeline
and
more complex pipelines
that build, test, and deploys a static site.
Review the
CI/CD YAML syntax reference
.
Set up and configure GitLab.
Test your GitLab instance.
Ensure
runners
are available, either by using shared GitLab.com runners or installing new runners.
Migration steps
Migrate projects from your SCM solution to GitLab.
(Recommended) You can use the available
importers
to automate mass imports from external SCM providers.
You can
import repositories by URL
.
Create a
.gitlab-ci.yml
file in each project.
Migrate TeamCity configuration to GitLab CI/CD jobs and configure them to show results directly in merge requests.
Migrate deployment jobs by using
cloud deployment templates
,
environments
, and the
GitLab agent for Kubernetes
.
Check if any CI/CD configuration can be reused across different projects, then create
and share
CI/CD templates
or
CI/CD components
.
