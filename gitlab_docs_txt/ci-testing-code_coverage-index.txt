Code coverage

Configure code coverage to track and visualize how much of your source code is covered by tests. You can:
Track overall coverage metrics and trends using the
coverage
keyword.
Visualize line-by-line coverage using the
artifacts:reports:coverage_report
keyword.
Configure coverage reporting
Use the
coverage
keyword to monitor your test coverage and enforce coverage requirements in merge requests.
With coverage reporting, you can:
Display the overall coverage percentage in merge requests.
Aggregate coverage from multiple test jobs.
Add coverage check approval rules.
Track coverage trends over time.
To configure coverage reporting:
Add the
coverage
keyword to your pipeline configuration:
test-unit
:
script
:
-
coverage run unit/
coverage
:
'/TOTAL.+ ([0-9]{1,3}%)/'
test-integration
:
script
:
-
coverage run integration/
coverage
:
'/TOTAL.+ ([0-9]{1,3}%)/'
Configure the regular expression (regex) to match your test output format.
See
coverage regex patterns
for common patterns.
To aggregate coverage from multiple jobs, add the
coverage
keyword to each job you want to include.
Optional.
Add a coverage check approval rule
.
Coverage regex patterns
The following sample regex patterns were designed to parse coverage output from common test coverage tools.
Test the regex patterns carefully. Tool output formats can change over time, and these patterns might no longer work as expected.

Coverage visualization
Use the
artifacts:reports:coverage_report
keyword to view which specific lines of code are covered by tests in merge requests.
You can generate coverage reports in these formats:
Cobertura: For multiple languages including Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
JaCoCo: For Java projects only.
Coverage visualization uses
artifacts reports
to:
Collect one or more coverage reports, including from wildcard paths.
Combine the coverage information from all reports.
Display the combined results in merge request diffs.
Coverage files are parsed in a background job, so there might be a delay between
pipeline completion and the visualization appearing in the merge request.
By default, coverage visualization data expires one week after creation.
Configure coverage visualization
To configure coverage visualization:
Configure your test tool to generate a coverage report.
Add the
artifacts:reports:coverage_report
configuration to your pipeline:
test
:
script
:
-
run tests with coverage
artifacts
:
reports
:
coverage_report
:
coverage_format
:
cobertura
# or jacoco
path
:
coverage/coverage.xml
For language-specific configuration details see:
Cobertura coverage report
JaCoCo coverage report
Coverage reports for child pipelines
Coverage reports for child pipelines appear in merge request diff annotations.
However, parent pipelines cannot access these coverage reports for use in their own jobs.
Support for parent pipelines to fetch coverage reports for child pipelines is proposed in
issue 285100
.
Add a coverage check approval rule
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate
You can require specific users or a group to approve merge requests that reduce the project’s test coverage.
Prerequisites:
Configure coverage reporting
.
To add a
Coverage-Check
approval rule:
Go to your project and select
Settings
>
Merge requests
.
Under
Merge request approvals
, do one of the following:
Next to the
Coverage-Check
approval rule, select
Enable
.
For manual setup, select
Add approval rule
, then enter
Coverage-Check
as the
Rule name
.
Select a
Target branch
.
Set the number of
Required number of approvals
.
Select the
Users
or
Groups
to provide approval.
Select
Save changes
.
The
Coverage-Check
approval rule requires approval when the merge base pipeline contains no coverage data, even if the merge request improves overall coverage.
View coverage results
After a pipeline runs successfully, you can view code coverage results in:
Merge request widget: See the coverage percentage and changes compared to the target branch.
Merge request diff: Review which lines are covered by tests. Available with Cobertura and JaCoCo reports.
Pipeline jobs: Monitor coverage results for individual jobs.
View coverage history
You can track the evolution of code coverage for your project or group over time.

test coverage report badges
.
Troubleshooting
Remove color codes from code coverage
Some test coverage tools output with ANSI color codes that aren’t
parsed correctly by the regular expression. This causes coverage
parsing to fail.
Some coverage tools do not provide an option to disable color
codes in the output. If so, pipe the output of the coverage tool through a one-line script that strips the color codes.
For example:
lein cloverage
|
perl -pe
's/\e\[?.*?[\@-~]//g'
