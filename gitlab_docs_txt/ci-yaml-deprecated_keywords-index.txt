Deprecated keywords
Some CI/CD keywords are deprecated and no longer recommended for use.
These keywords are still usable to ensure backwards compatibility,
but could be scheduled for removal in a future major milestone.
Globally-defined
image
,
services
,
cache
,
before_script
,
after_script
Defining
image
,
services
,
cache
,
before_script
, and
after_script
globally is deprecated.
Use
default
instead.
For example:
default
:
image
:
ruby:3.0
services
:
-
docker:dind
cache
:
paths
:
[
vendor/]
before_script
:
-
bundle config set path vendor/bundle
-
bundle install
after_script
:
-
rm -rf tmp/
only
/
except
only
and
except
are deprecated. To control when to add jobs to pipelines, use
rules
instead.
You can use
only
and
except
to control when to add jobs to pipelines.
Use
only
to define when a job runs.
Use
except
to define when a job
does not
run.
only:refs
/
except:refs
only:refs
and
except:refs
are deprecated. To use refs, regular expressions, or variables
to control when to add jobs to pipelines, use
rules:if
instead.
You can use the
only:refs
and
except:refs
keywords to control when to add jobs to a
pipeline based on branch names or pipeline types.
Keyword type
: Job keyword. You can use it only as part of a job.
Supported values
: An array including any number of:
Branch names, for example
main
or
my-feature-branch
.
Regular expressions that match against branch names, for example
/^feature-.*/
.
The following keywords:
Value
Description
api
For pipelines triggered by the
pipelines API
.
branches
When the Git reference for a pipeline is a branch.
chat
For pipelines created by using a
GitLab ChatOps
command.
external
When you use CI services other than GitLab.
external_pull_requests
When an external pull request on GitHub is created or updated (See
Pipelines for external pull requests
).
merge_requests
For pipelines created when a merge request is created or updated. Enables
merge request pipelines
,
merged results pipelines
, and
merge trains
.
pipelines
For
multi-project pipelines
created by
using the API with
CI_JOB_TOKEN
, or the
trigger
keyword.
pushes
For pipelines triggered by a
git push
event, including for branches and tags.
schedules
For
scheduled pipelines
.
tags
When the Git reference for a pipeline is a tag.
triggers
For pipelines created by using a
trigger token
.
web
For pipelines created by selecting
New pipeline
in the GitLab UI, from the project’s
Build
>
Pipelines
section.
Example of
only:refs
and
except:refs
:
job1
:
script
:
echo
only
:
-
main
-
/^issue-.*$/
-
merge_requests
job2
:
script
:
echo
except
:
-
main
-
/^stable-branch.*$/
-
schedules
Additional details
:
Scheduled pipelines run on specific branches, so jobs configured with
only: branches
run on scheduled pipelines too. Add
except: schedules
to prevent jobs with
only: branches
from running on scheduled pipelines.
only
or
except
used without any other keywords are equivalent to
only: refs
or
except: refs
. For example, the following two jobs configurations have the same
behavior:
job1
:
script
:
echo
only
:
-
branches
job2
:
script
:
echo
only
:
refs
:
-
branches
If a job does not use
only
,
except
, or
rules
, then
only
is set to
branches
and
tags
by default.
For example,
job1
and
job2
are equivalent:
job1
:
script
:
echo "test"
job2
:
script
:
echo "test"
only
:
-
branches
-
tags
only:variables
/
except:variables
only:variables
and
except:variables
are deprecated. To use refs, regular expressions, or variables
to control when to add jobs to pipelines, use
rules:if
instead.
You can use the
only:variables
or
except:variables
keywords to control when to add jobs
to a pipeline, based on the status of
CI/CD variables
.
Keyword type
: Job keyword. You can use it only as part of a job.
Supported values
:
An array of
CI/CD variable expressions
.
Example of
only:variables
:
deploy
:
script
:
cap staging deploy
only
:
variables
:
-
$RELEASE == "staging"
-
$STAGING
only:changes
/
except:changes
only:changes
and
except:changes
are deprecated. To use changed files to control
when to add a job to a pipeline, use
rules:changes
instead.
Use the
changes
keyword with
only
to run a job, or with
except
to skip a job,
when a Git push event modifies a file.
Use
changes
in pipelines with the following refs:
branches
external_pull_requests
merge_requests
Keyword type
: Job keyword. You can use it only as part of a job.
Supported values
: An array including any number of:
Paths to files.
Wildcard paths for:
Single directories, for example
path/to/directory/*
.
A directory and all its subdirectories, for example
path/to/directory/**/*
.
Wildcard
glob
paths for all files
with the same extension or multiple extensions, for example
*.md
or
path/to/directory/*.{rb,py,sh}
.
Wildcard paths to files in the root directory, or all directories, wrapped in double quotes.
For example
"*.json"
or
"**/*.json"
.
Example of
only:changes
:
docker build
:
script
:
docker build -t my-image:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG .
only
:
refs
:
-
branches
changes
:
-
Dockerfile
-
docker/scripts/*
-
dockerfiles/**/*
-
more_scripts/*.{rb,py,sh}
-
"**/*.json"
Additional details
:
changes
resolves to
true
if any of the matching files are changed (an
OR
operation).
Glob patterns are interpreted with Ruby’s
File.fnmatch
with the
flags
File::FNM_PATHNAME | File::FNM_DOTMATCH | File::FNM_EXTGLOB
.
If you use refs other than
branches
,
external_pull_requests
, or
merge_requests
,
changes
can’t determine if a given file is new or old and always returns
true
.
If you use
only: changes
with other refs, jobs ignore the changes and always run.
If you use
except: changes
with other refs, jobs ignore the changes and never run.

only:kubernetes
/
except:kubernetes
only:kubernetes
and
except:kubernetes
are deprecated. To control if jobs are added to the pipeline
when the Kubernetes service is active in the project, use
rules:if
with the
CI_KUBERNETES_ACTIVE
