GitLab CI/CD artifacts reports types
Tier
: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering
: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
Use
artifacts:reports
to:
Collect test reports, code quality reports, security reports, and other artifacts generated by included templates in
jobs.
Some of these reports are used to display information in:
Merge requests.
Pipeline views.
Security dashboards
.
Artifacts created for
artifacts: reports
are always uploaded, regardless of the job results (success or failure).
You can use
artifacts:expire_in
to set an expiration
time for the artifacts, which overrides the instance’s
default setting
.
GitLab.com might have a
different default artifacts expiry value
.
Some
artifacts:reports
types can be generated by multiple jobs in the same pipeline, and used by merge request or
pipeline features from each job.
To browse the report output files, ensure you include the
artifacts:paths
keyword in your job definition.
Combined reports in parent pipelines using
artifacts from child pipelines
is
not supported. Support for this feature is proposed in
epic 8205
.
artifacts:reports:accessibility
The
accessibility
report uses
pa11y
to report on the accessibility impact
of changes introduced in merge requests.
GitLab can display the results of one or more reports in the merge request
accessibility widget
.
For more information, see
Accessibility testing
.
artifacts:reports:annotations
History
Introduced
in GitLab 16.3.
The
annotations
report is used to attach auxiliary data to a job.
An annotations report is a JSON file with annotation sections. Each annotation
section can have any desired name and can have any number of annotations of the
same or differing types.
Each annotation is a single key (the annotation type), containing the subkeys with
the data for that annotation.
Annotation types
external_link
An
external_link
annotation can be attached to a job to add a link to the job
output page. The value of an
external_link
annotation is an object with the
following keys:
Key
Description
label
The human-readable label associated with the link.
url
The URL pointed to by the link.
Example report
The following is an example of what a job annotations report might look like:
{
"my_annotation_section_1"
:
[
{
"external_link"
:
{
"label"
:
"URL 1"
,
"url"
:
"https://url1.example.com/"
}
},
{
"external_link"
:
{
"label"
:
"URL 2"
,
"url"
:
"https://url2.example.com/"
}
}
]
}

artifacts:reports:cyclonedx
Tier
: Ultimate
This report is a Software Bill of Materials describing the components of a project
following the
CycloneDX
protocol format.
You can specify multiple CycloneDX reports per job. These can be either supplied
as a list of filenames, a filename pattern, or both:
A filename pattern (
cyclonedx: gl-sbom-*.json
,
junit: test-results/**/*.json
).
An array of filenames (
cyclonedx: [gl-sbom-npm-npm.cdx.json, gl-sbom-bundler-gem.cdx.json]
).
A combination of both (
cyclonedx: [gl-sbom-*.json, my-cyclonedx.json]
).
Directories are not supported(
cyclonedx: test-results
,
cyclonedx: test-results/**
).
The following example shows a job that exposes CycloneDX artifacts:

artifacts:reports:dotenv
The
dotenv
report collects a set of environment variables as artifacts.
The collected variables are registered as runtime-created variables of the job,
which you can
use in subsequent job scripts
or to
set dynamic environment URLs after a job finishes
.
If duplicate environment variables are present in a
dotenv
report, the last one specified is used.
You should avoid storing sensitive data like credentials in dotenv reports, as the
reports can be downloaded from the pipeline details page. If necessary, you can use
artifacts:access
to restrict the users that can download
the report artifacts in a job.
GitLab uses the
dotenv
gem
for handling dotenv files,
but applies additional restrictions beyond both
the original dotenv rules
and the gem’s implementation:
The maximum size of the dotenv file is 5 KB.
This limit
can be changed on GitLab Self-Managed
.
On GitLab.com,
the maximum number of inherited variables
is 50 for Free, 100 for Premium, and 150 for Ultimate. The default for
GitLab Self-Managed is 20, and can be changed with the
dotenv_variables
application limit
.
Only UTF-8 encoding is
supported
.
The dotenv file cannot contain empty lines or comments (starting with
#
).
The variable name can contain only ASCII letters (
A-Za-z
), digits (
0-9
), and underscores (
_
).
The dotenv file does not support quoting. Single or double quotes are preserved as-is and cannot be used for escaping.
Multiline values in the dotenv file
are not supported.
GitLab rejects the dotenv file on upload.
Leading and trailing spaces or newline characters (
\n
) are stripped.
Variable substitution (
${var}
) in the dotenv file is not supported.
GitLab resolves variable substitutions to empty strings when the file is processed.
artifacts:reports:junit
The
junit
report collects
JUnit report format XML files
.
The collected Unit test reports upload to GitLab as an artifact. Although JUnit was originally developed in Java, there
are many third-party ports for other languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
See
Unit test reports
for more details and examples.
The following example shows how to collect a JUnit XML report from Ruby RSpec tests:
rspec
:
stage

test
script
:
-
bundle install
-
rspec --format RspecJunitFormatter --out rspec.xml

:
reports
:
junit
:
rspec.xml
GitLab can display the results of one or more reports in:
The merge request
Test summary
panel
.
The
pipeline
Tests
tab
.
Some JUnit tools export to multiple XML files. You can specify multiple test report paths in a single job to
concatenate them into a single file. Use either:
A filename pattern (
junit: rspec-*.xml
,
junit: test-results/**/*.xml
).
An array of filenames (
junit: [rspec-1.xml, rspec-2.xml, rspec-3.xml]
).
A combination of both (
junit: [rspec.xml, test-results/TEST-*.xml]
