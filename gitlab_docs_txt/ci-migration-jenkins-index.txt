If you’re migrating from Jenkins to GitLab CI/CD, you are able to create CI/CD
pipelines that replicate and enhance your Jenkins workflows.
Key similarities and differences
GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins are CI/CD tools with some similarities. Both GitLab
and Jenkins:
Use stages for collections of jobs.
Support container-based builds.
Additionally, there are some important differences between the two:
GitLab CI/CD pipelines are all configured in a YAML format configuration file.
Jenkins uses either a Groovy format configuration file (declarative pipelines)
or Jenkins DSL (scripted pipelines).
GitLab offers
GitLab.com
, a multi-tenant SaaS service,
and
GitLab Dedicated
, a fully isolated
single-tenant SaaS service. You can also run your own
GitLab Self-Managed
instance. Jenkins deployments must be self-hosted.
GitLab provides source code management (SCM) out of the box. Jenkins requires a separate
SCM solution to store code.
GitLab provides a built-in container registry. Jenkins requires a separate solution
for storing container images.
GitLab provides built-in templates for scanning code. Jenkins requires 3rd party plugins
for scanning code.
Comparison of features and concepts
Many Jenkins features and concepts have equivalents in GitLab that offer the same
functionality.
Configuration file
Jenkins can be configured with a
Jenkinsfile
in the Groovy format
. GitLab CI/CD uses a
.gitlab-ci.yml
file by default.
Example of a
Jenkinsfile
:
pipeline
{
agent
any
stages
{
stage
(
'hello'
)
{
steps
{
echo
"Hello World"
}
}
}
}
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
stages
:
-
hello
hello-job
:
stage
:
hello
script
:
-
echo "Hello World"
Jenkins pipeline syntax
A Jenkins configuration is composed of a
pipeline
block with sections and directives.
GitLab CI/CD has similar functionality, configured with YAML keywords.
Sections
Jenkins
GitLab
Explanation
agent
image
Jenkins pipelines execute on agents, and the
agent
section defines how the pipeline executes, and the Docker container to use. GitLab jobs execute on runners, and the
image
keyword defines the container to use. You can configure your own runners in Kubernetes or on any host.
post
after_script
or
stage
The Jenkins
post
section defines actions that should be performed at the end of a stage or pipeline. In GitLab, use
after_script
for commands to run at the end of a job, and
before_script
for actions to run before the other commands in a job. Use
stage
to select the exact stage a job should run in. GitLab supports both
.pre
and
.post
stages that always run before or after all other defined stages.
stages
stages
Jenkins stages are groups of jobs. GitLab CI/CD also uses stages, but it is more flexible. You can have multiple stages each with multiple independent jobs. Use
stages
at the top level to the stages and their execution order, and use
stage
at the job level to define the stage for that job.
steps
script
Jenkins
steps
define what to execute. GitLab CI/CD uses a
script
section which is similar. The
script
section is a YAML array with separate entries for each command to run in sequence.
Directives
Jenkins
GitLab
Explanation
environment
variables
Jenkins uses
environment
for environment variables. GitLab CI/CD uses the
variables
keyword to define CI/CD variables that can be used during job execution, but also for more dynamic pipeline configuration. These can also be set in the GitLab UI, under CI/CD settings.
options
Not applicable
Jenkins uses
options
for additional configuration, including timeouts and retry values. GitLab does not need a separate section for options, all configuration is added as CI/CD keywords at the job or pipeline level, for example
timeout
or
retry
.
parameters
Not applicable
In Jenkins, parameters can be required when triggering a pipeline. Parameters are handled in GitLab with CI/CD variables, which can be defined in many places, including the pipeline configuration, project settings, at runtime manually through the UI, or API.
triggers
rules
In Jenkins,
triggers
defines when a pipeline should run again, for example through cron notation. GitLab CI/CD can run pipelines automatically for many reasons, including Git changes and merge request updates. Use the
rules
keyword to control which events to run jobs for. Scheduled pipelines are defined in the project settings.
tools
Not applicable
In Jenkins,
tools
defines additional tools to install in the environment. GitLab does not have a similar keyword, as the recommendation is to use container images prebuilt with the exact tools required for your jobs. These images can be cached and can be built to already contain the tools you need for your pipelines. If a job needs additional tools, they can be installed as part of a
before_script
section.
input
Not applicable
In Jenkins,
input
adds a prompt for user input. Similar to
parameters
, inputs are handled in GitLab through CI/CD variables.
when
rules
In Jenkins,
when
defines when a stage should be executed. GitLab also has a
when
keyword, which defines whether a job should start running based on the status of earlier jobs, for example if jobs passed or failed. To control when to add jobs to specific pipelines, use
rules
.
Common configurations
This section goes over commonly used CI/CD configurations, showing how they can be converted
from Jenkins to GitLab CI/CD.
Jenkins pipelines
generate automated CI/CD jobs
that are triggered when certain event take place, such as a new commit being pushed.
A Jenkins pipeline is defined in a
Jenkinsfile
. The GitLab equivalent is the
.gitlab-ci.yml
configuration file
.
Jenkins does not provide a place to store source code, so the
Jenkinsfile
must be stored
in a separate source control repository.
Jobs
Jobs are a set of commands that run in a set sequence to achieve a particular result.
For example, build a container then deploy it to production, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
pipeline
{
agent
any
stages
{
stage
(
'build'
)
{
agent
{
docker
'golang:alpine'
}
steps
{
apk
update
go
build
-
o
bin
/hello
}
post {
always {
archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'bin/
hello
'
onlyIfSuccessful: true
}
}
}
stage('
deploy
') {
agent { docker '
golang:
alpine
' }
when {
branch '
staging
'
}
steps
{
echo
"Deploying to staging"
scp
bin
/hello remoteuser@remotehost:/
remote
/
directory
}
}
}
}
This example:
Uses the
golang:alpine
container image.
Runs a job for building code.
Stores the built executable as an artifact.
Adds a second job to deploy to
staging
, which:
Only exists if the commit targets the
staging
branch.
Starts after the build stage succeeds.
Uses the built executable artifact from the earlier job.
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
default
:
image
:
golang:alpine
stages
:
-
build
-
deploy
build-job
:
stage
:
build
script
:
-
apk update
-
go build -o bin/hello
artifacts
:
paths
:
-
bin/hello
expire_in
:
1
week
deploy-job
:
stage
:
deploy
script
:
-
echo "Deploying to Staging"
-
scp bin/hello remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/directory
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == 'staging'
artifacts
:
paths
:
-
bin/hello
Parallel
In Jenkins, jobs that are not dependent on previous jobs can run in parallel when
added to a
parallel
section.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
pipeline
{
agent
any
stages
{
stage
(
'Parallel'
)
{
parallel
{
stage
(
'Python'
)
{
agent
{
docker
'python:latest'
}
steps
{
sh
"python --version"
}
}
stage
(
'Java'
)
{
agent
{
docker
'openjdk:latest'
}
when
{
branch
'staging'
}
steps
{
sh
"java -version"
}
}
}
}
}
}
This example runs a Python and a Java job in parallel, using different container images.
The Java job only runs when the
staging
branch is changed.
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
python-version
:
image
:
python:latest
script
:
-
python --version
java-version
:
image
:
openjdk:latest
rules
:
-
if
:
$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == 'staging'
script
:
-
java -version
In this case, no extra configuration is needed to make the jobs run in parallel.
Jobs run in parallel by default, each on a different runner assuming there are enough runners
for all the jobs. The Java job is set to only run when the
staging
branch is changed.
Matrix
In GitLab you can use a matrix to run a job multiple times in parallel in a single pipeline,
but with different variable values for each instance of the job. Jenkins runs the matrix sequentially.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
matrix
{
axes
{
axis
{
name
'PLATFORM'
values
'linux'
,
'mac'
,
'windows'
}
axis
{
name
'ARCH'
values
'x64'
,
'x86'
}
}
stages
{
stage
(
'build'
)
{
echo
"Building $PLATFORM for $ARCH"
}
stage
(
'test'
)
{
echo
"Building $PLATFORM for $ARCH"
}
stage
(
'deploy'
)
{
echo
"Building $PLATFORM for $ARCH"
}
}
}
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
stages
:
-
build
-
test
-
deploy
.parallel-hidden-job
:
parallel
:
matrix
:
-
PLATFORM
:
[
linux, mac, windows]
ARCH
:
[
x64, x86]
build-job
:
extends
:
.parallel-hidden-job
stage
:
build
script
:
-
echo "Building $PLATFORM for $ARCH"
test-job
:
extends
:
.parallel-hidden-job
stage
:
test
script
:
-
echo "Testing $PLATFORM for $ARCH"
deploy-job
:
extends
:
.parallel-hidden-job
stage
:
deploy
script
:
-
echo "Testing $PLATFORM for $ARCH"
Container Images
In GitLab you can
run your CI/CD jobs in separate, isolated Docker containers
using the
image
keyword.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
stage
(
'Version'
)
{
agent
{
docker
'python:latest'
}
steps
{
echo
'Hello Python'
sh
'python --version'
}
}
This example shows commands running in a
python:latest
container.
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
version-job
:
image
:
python:latest
script
:
-
echo "Hello Python"
-
python --version
Variables
In GitLab, use the
variables
keyword to define
CI/CD variables
.
Use variables to reuse configuration data, have more dynamic configuration, or store important values.
Variables can be defined either globally or per job.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
pipeline
{
agent
any
environment
{
NAME
=
'Fern'
}
stages
{
stage
(
'English'
)
{
environment
{
GREETING
=
'Hello'
}
steps
{
sh
'echo "$GREETING $NAME"'
}
}
stage
(
'Spanish'
)
{
environment
{
GREETING
=
'Hola'
}
steps
{
sh
'echo "$GREETING $NAME"'
}
}
}
}
This example shows how variables can be used to pass values to commands in jobs.
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
default
:
image
:
alpine:latest
stages
:
-
greet
variables
:
NAME
:
"Fern"
english
:
stage
:
greet
variables
:
GREETING
:
"Hello"
script
:
-
echo "$GREETING $NAME"
spanish
:
stage
:
greet
variables
:
GREETING
:
"Hola"
script
:
-
echo "$GREETING $NAME"
Variables can also be
set in the GitLab UI, in the CI/CD settings
.
In some cases, you can use
protected
and
masked
variables for secret values.
These variables can be accessed in pipeline jobs the same as variables defined in the
configuration file.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
pipeline
{
agent
any
stages
{
stage
(
'Example Username/Password'
)
{
environment
{
AWS_ACCESS_KEY
=
credentials
(
'aws-access-key'
)
}
steps
{
sh
'my-login-script.sh $AWS_ACCESS_KEY'
}
}
}
}
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
login-job
:
script
:
-
my-login-script.sh $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
Additionally, GitLab CI/CD makes
predefined variables
available to every pipeline and job which contain values relevant to the pipeline and repository.
Expressions and conditionals
When a new pipeline starts, GitLab checks which jobs should run in that pipeline.
You can configure jobs to run depending on factors like the status of variables,
or the pipeline type.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
stage
(
'deploy_staging'
)
{
agent
{
docker
'alpine:latest'
}
when
{
branch
'staging'
}
steps
{
echo
"Deploying to staging"
}
}
In this example, the job only runs when the branch you are committing to is named
staging
.
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
deploy_staging
:
stage
:
deploy
script
:
-
echo "Deploy to staging server"
rules
:
-
if
:
'$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == staging'
Runners
Like Jenkins agents, GitLab runners are the hosts that run jobs. If you are using GitLab.com,
you can use the
instance runner fleet
to run jobs without provisioning
your own runners.
To convert a Jenkins agent for use with GitLab CI/CD, uninstall the agent and then
install and register a runner
. Runners do not require much overhead,
so you might be able to use similar provisioning as the Jenkins agents you were using.
Some key details about runners:
Runners can be
configured
to be shared across an instance,
a group, or dedicated to a single project.
You can use the
tags
keyword
for finer control, and associate runners with specific jobs. For example, you can use a tag for jobs that
require dedicated, more powerful, or specific hardware.
GitLab has
autoscaling for runners
.
Use autoscaling to provision runners only when needed and scale down when not needed.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
pipeline
{
agent
none
stages
{
stage
(
'Linux'
)
{
agent
{
label
'linux'
}
steps
{
echo
"Hello, $USER"
}
}
stage
(
'Windows'
)
{
agent
{
label
'windows'
}
steps
{
echo
"Hello, %USERNAME%"
}
}
}
}
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
linux_job
:
stage
:
build
tags
:
-
linux
script
:
-
echo "Hello, $USER"
windows_job
:
stage
:
build
tags
:
-
windows
script
:
-
echo "Hello, %USERNAME%"
Artifacts
In GitLab, any job can use the
artifacts
keyword to define a set of artifacts to
be stored when a job completes.
Artifacts
are files that can be used in later jobs,
for example for testing or deployment.
For example, in a
Jenkinsfile
:
stages
{
stage
(
'Generate Cat'
)
{
steps
{
sh
'touch cat.txt'
sh
'echo "meow" > cat.txt'
}
post
{
always
{
archiveArtifacts
artifacts:
'cat.txt'
onlyIfSuccessful:
true
}
}
}
stage
(
'Use Cat'
)
{
steps
{
sh
'cat cat.txt'
}
}
}
The equivalent GitLab CI/CD
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would be:
stages
:
-
generate
-
use
generate_cat
:
stage
:
generate
script
:
-
touch cat.txt
-
echo "meow" > cat.txt
artifacts
:
paths
:
-
cat.txt
expire_in
:
1
week
use_cat
:
stage
:
use
script
:
-
cat cat.txt
artifacts
:
paths
:
-
cat.txt
Caching
A
cache
is created when a job downloads one or more files and
saves them for faster access in the future. Subsequent jobs that use the same cache don’t have to download the files again,
so they execute more quickly. The cache is stored on the runner and uploaded to S3 if
distributed cache is enabled
.
Jenkins core does not provide caching.
For example, in a
.gitlab-ci.yml
file:
cache-job
:
script
:
-
echo "This job uses a cache."
cache
:
key
:
binaries-cache-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
paths
:
-
binaries/
Jenkins plugins
Some functionality in Jenkins that is enabled through plugins is supported natively
in GitLab with keywords and features that offer similar functionality. For example:
Jenkins plugin
GitLab feature
Build Timeout
timeout
keyword
Cobertura
Coverage report artifacts
and
Code coverage
Code coverage API
Code coverage
and
Coverage visualization
Embeddable Build Status
Pipeline status badges
JUnit
JUnit test report artifacts
and
Unit test reports
Mailer
Notification emails
Parameterized Trigger Plugin
trigger
keyword
and
downstream pipelines
Role-based Authorization Strategy
GitLab
permissions and roles
Timestamper
Job
logs are time stamped by default
Security Scanning features
You might have used plugins for things like code quality, security, or static application scanning in Jenkins.
GitLab provides
security scanners
out-of-the-box to detect
vulnerabilities in all parts of the SDLC. You can add these plugins in GitLab using templates, for example to add
SAST scanning to your pipeline, add the following to your
.gitlab-ci.yml
:
include
:
-
template
:
Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
You can customize the behavior of security scanners by using CI/CD variables, for example
with the
SAST scanners
.
Secrets Management
Privileged information, often referred to as “secrets”, is sensitive information
or credentials you need in your CI/CD workflow. You might use secrets to unlock protected resources
or sensitive information in tools, applications, containers, and cloud-native environments.
Secrets management in Jenkins is usually handled with the
Secret
type field or the
Credentials Plugin. Credentials stored in the Jenkins settings can be exposed to
jobs as environment variables by using the Credentials Binding plugin.
For secrets management in GitLab, you can use one of the
supported integrations
for an external service. These services securely store secrets outside of your GitLab project,
though you must have a subscription for the service.
GitLab also supports
OIDC authentication
for other third party services that support OIDC.
Additionally, you can make credentials available to jobs by storing them in CI/CD variables, though secrets
stored in plain text are susceptible to accidental exposure,
the same as in Jenkins
.
You should always store sensitive information in
masked
and
protected
variables, which mitigates
some of the risk.
Also, never store secrets as variables in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file, which is public to all
users with access to the project. Storing sensitive information in variables should
only be done in
the project, group, or instance settings
.
Review the
security guidelines
to improve
the safety of your CI/CD variables.
Planning and Performing a Migration
The following list of recommended steps was created after observing organizations
that were able to quickly complete this migration.
Create a Migration Plan
Before starting a migration you should create a
migration plan
to make preparations for the migration. For a migration from Jenkins, ask yourself the following questions in preparation:
What plugins are used by jobs in Jenkins today?
Do you know what these plugins do exactly?
Do any plugins wrap a common build tool? For example, Maven, Gradle, or NPM?
What is installed on the Jenkins agents?
Are there any shared libraries in use?
How are you authenticating from Jenkins? Are you using SSH keys, API tokens, or other secrets?
Are there other projects that you need to access from your pipeline?
Are there credentials in Jenkins to access outside services? For example Ansible Tower,
Artifactory, or other Cloud Providers or deployment targets?
Prerequisites
Before doing any migration work, you should first:
Get familiar with GitLab.
Read about the
key GitLab CI/CD features
.
Follow tutorials to create
your first GitLab pipeline
and
more complex pipelines
that build, test, and deploys a static site.
Review the
CI/CD YAML syntax reference
.
Set up and configure GitLab.
Test your GitLab instance.
Ensure
runners
are available, either by using shared GitLab.com runners or installing new runners.
Migration Steps
Migrate projects from your SCM solution to GitLab.
(Recommended) You can use the available
importers
to automate mass imports from external SCM providers.
You can
import repositories by URL
.
Create a
.gitlab-ci.yml
file in each project.
Migrate Jenkins configuration to GitLab CI/CD jobs and configure them to show results directly in merge requests.
Migrate deployment jobs by using
cloud deployment templates
,
environments
, and the
GitLab agent for Kubernetes
.
Check if any CI/CD configuration can be reused across different projects, then create
and share CI/CD templates.
Check the
pipeline efficiency documentation
to learn how to make your GitLab CI/CD pipelines faster and more efficient.
Additional Resources
You can use the
JenkinsFile Wrapper
to run a complete Jenkins instance inside of a GitLab CI/CD job, including plugins. Use this tool to help ease the transition to GitLab CI/CD, by delaying the migration of less urgent pipelines.
The JenkinsFile Wrapper is not packaged with GitLab and falls outside of the scope of support.
For more information, see the
Statement of Support
.
If you have questions that are not answered here, the
GitLab community forum
can be a great resource.
