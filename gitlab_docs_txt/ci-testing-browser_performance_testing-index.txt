Browser Performance Testing
Tier
: Premium, Ultimate

If your application offers a web interface and you’re using
GitLab CI/CD
, you can quickly determine the rendering performance
impact of pending code changes in the browser.
You can automate this feature in your applications by using
Auto DevOps
.
GitLab uses
Sitespeed.io
, a free and open source
tool, for measuring the rendering performance of web sites. The
Sitespeed plugin
that GitLab built outputs
the performance score for each page analyzed in a file called
browser-performance.json
this data can be shown on merge requests.
Use cases
Consider the following workflow:
A member of the marketing team is attempting to track engagement by adding a new tool.
With browser performance metrics, they see how their changes are impacting the usability
of the page for end users.
The metrics show that after their changes, the performance score of the page has gone down.
When looking at the detailed report, they see the new JavaScript library was
included in
<head>
, which affects loading page speed.
They ask for help from a front end developer, who sets the library to load asynchronously.
The frontend developer approves the merge request, and authorizes its deployment to production.
How browser performance testing works
First, define a job in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file that generates the
Browser Performance report artifact
.
GitLab then checks this report, compares key performance metrics for each page
between the source and target branches, and shows the information in the merge request.
For an example Browser Performance job, see
Configuring Browser Performance Testing
.
If the Browser Performance report has no data to compare, such as when you add the
Browser Performance job in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
for the very first time,
the Browser Performance report widget doesn’t display. It must have run at least
once on the target branch (
main
, for example), before it displays in a
merge request targeting that branch. Additionally, the widget only displays if the
job ran in the latest pipeline for the Merge request.
Configuring Browser Performance Testing
History
Support for the
SITESPEED_DOCKER_OPTIONS
variable
introduced
in GitLab 16.6.
This example shows how to run the
sitespeed.io container
on your code by using GitLab CI/CD and
sitespeed.io
using Docker-in-Docker.
First, set up GitLab Runner with a
Docker-in-Docker build
.
Configure the default Browser Performance Testing CI/CD job as follows in your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file:
include
:
template
:
Verify/Browser-Performance.gitlab-ci.yml
browser_performance
:
variables
:
URL
:
https://example.com
The previous example:
Creates a
browser_performance
job in your CI/CD pipeline and runs sitespeed.io against the webpage you
defined in
URL
to gather key metrics.
Uses a template that doesn’t work with Kubernetes clusters. If you are using a Kubernetes cluster,
use
template: Jobs/Browser-Performance-Testing.gitlab-ci.yml
instead.
The template uses the
GitLab plugin for sitespeed.io
,
and it saves the full HTML sitespeed.io report as a
Browser Performance report artifact
that you can later download and analyze. This implementation always takes the latest
Browser Performance artifact available. If
GitLab Pages
is enabled,
you can view the report directly in your browser.
You can also customize the jobs with CI/CD variables:
SITESPEED_IMAGE
: Configure the Docker image to use for the job (default
sitespeedio/sitespeed.io
), but not the image version.
SITESPEED_VERSION
: Configure the version of the Docker image to use for the job (default
14.1.0
).
SITESPEED_OPTIONS
: Configure any additional sitespeed.io options as required (default
nil
). Refer to the
sitespeed.io documentation
for more details.
SITESPEED_DOCKER_OPTIONS
: Configure any additional Docker options (default
nil
). Refer to the
Docker options documentation
for more details.
For example, you can override the number of runs sitespeed.io
makes on the given URL, and change the version:
include
:
template
:
Verify/Browser-Performance.gitlab-ci.yml
browser_performance
:
variables
:
URL
:
https://www.sitespeed.io/
SITESPEED_VERSION
:
13.2.0
SITESPEED_OPTIONS
:
-
n
5
Configuring degradation threshold
You can configure the sensitivity of degradation alerts to avoid getting alerts for minor drops in metrics.
This is done by setting the
DEGRADATION_THRESHOLD
CI/CD variable. In the following example, the alert only shows up
if the
Total Score
metric degrades by 5 points or more:
include
:
template
:
Verify/Browser-Performance.gitlab-ci.yml
browser_performance
:
variables
:
URL
:
https://example.com
DEGRADATION_THRESHOLD
:
5
The
Total Score
metric is based on sitespeed.io’s
coach performance score
. There is more information in
the coach documentation
.
Performance testing on review apps
The previous CI YAML configuration is great for testing against static environments, and it can
be extended for dynamic environments, but a few extra steps are required:
The
browser_performance
job should run after the dynamic environment has started.
In the
review
job:
Generate a URL list file with the dynamic URL.
Save the file as an artifact, for example with
echo $CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL > environment_url.txt
in your job’s
script
.
Pass the list as the URL environment variable (which can be a URL or a file containing URLs)
to the
browser_performance
job.
You can now run the sitespeed.io container against the desired hostname and
paths.
Your
.gitlab-ci.yml
file would look like:

-
